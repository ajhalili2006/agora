Go back to [[Week 3 - Introduction]]

The jobs of certain creatives such as photographers and models are already being replaced by AI-created images (p27):

	Eventoday, resources like Rosebud.AI and Icons8 sup-portgeneration of photos of non-existent people inscribed in required interiors that  may be  used as illustrations and substitute photo shoots for publications. According to cre-ators  of  those  photos,  in  the  future,  their  cost  would  let avoid referring to photobanks or services of professional photographers. The   technology,   whose   potential   was highly  appraised  by  e-commerce, is  now  conquering  the media  market. Lil  Miquela, a 3Dmodel  girl, created  by Brud company  developers,  is  known  to  advertise  brands like Calvin Klein, Loreal, “wears”clothes of world-famous brands  and  has  repeatedly  appeared  on  covers  of Time, L'Officiel Singapore, Elle Mexico, etc. 

This isn't useful for documentary photography or news photography (p27), but this does intersect with the threat coming from realfakes.
