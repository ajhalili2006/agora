### natural language generation

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]

Natural Language Generation (NLG) is a use of [[Artificial Intelligence/Introduction to AI/Week 3 - Introduction/Natural Language Processing]] (NLP) which is covered in my notes on [[Artificial Intelligence/Week 2/Natural Language Processing| Natural Language Processing in AI]]

The use of cognitive technology via machine algorithms to generate content taken from data and turn it into a natural languge form. 

[Associated Press](https://automatedinsights.com/customer-stories/associated-press/) used NLG when it used the [Wordsmith](https://automatedinsights.com/wordsmith/) platform from [Automated Insights](https://automatedinsights.com/).
