# News to audience relationship has changed over 20 years

Go back to [[Week 3 - Introduction]]

The journalist is no longer the only source of news and the audience is no longer a passive consumer of it anymore. 

Both, with technology as a catalyst and third party, are taking part in an active process of creation, communication, and in some cases, conflict. 

	These changes have reflected on the relationship between the journalist as a producer of news and the public as a consumer and recipient, The journalist is no longer the only producer of information, news and  opinion, while  audience  is  no  longer  just  a  passive  recipient  of  it,  but  has  become  an  active participant  in  the  journalism  process,  this  has  led  to  many  transformations  related  to  the  identity  of journalism, its mission, roles and practices(1).
