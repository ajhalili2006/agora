#fairness
Applying a constraint to an algorithm to ensure one or more definitions of fairness are satisfied. Examples of fairness constraints include:

- Altering the loss function to incorporate a penalty for violating a fairness metric.
- Directly adding a mathematical constraint to an optimization problem.
