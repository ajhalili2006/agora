### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


An error metric calculated by taking an average of absolute errors. In the context of evaluating a modelâ€™s accuracy, MAE is the average absolute difference between the expected and predicted values across all training examples. Specifically, for `n` examples, for each value `y` and its prediction `y-hat`, MAE is defined as follows:
