### one-vs.-all

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Given a classification problem with N possible solutions, a one-vs.-all solution consists of N separate binary classifiersâ€”one binary classifier for each possible outcome. For example, given a model that classifies examples as animal, vegetable, or mineral, a one-vs.-all solution would provide the following three separate binary classifiers:

    animal vs. not animal
    vegetable vs. not vegetable
    mineral vs. not mineral
