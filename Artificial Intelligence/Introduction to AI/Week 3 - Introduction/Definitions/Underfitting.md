### underfitting

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Producing a model with poor predictive ability because the model hasn't captured the complexity of the training data. Many problems can cause underfitting, including:

    Training on the wrong set of features.
    Training for too few epochs or at too low a learning rate.
    Training with too high a regularization rate.
    Providing too few hidden layers in a deep neural network.
