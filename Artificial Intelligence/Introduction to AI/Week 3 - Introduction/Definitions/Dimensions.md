Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Overloaded term having any of the following definitions:

    The number of levels of coordinates in a Tensor. For example:
        A scalar has zero dimensions; for example, ["Hello"].
        A vector has one dimension; for example, [3, 5, 7, 11].
        A matrix has two dimensions; for example, [[2, 4, 18], [5, 7, 14]].

You can uniquely specify a particular cell in a one-dimensional vector with one coordinate; you need two coordinates to uniquely specify a particular cell in a two-dimensional matrix.

    The number of entries in a feature vector.

    The number of elements in an embedding layer.
