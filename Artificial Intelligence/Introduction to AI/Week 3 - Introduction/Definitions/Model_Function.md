### model function

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]

#TensorFlow

The function within an Estimator that implements machine learning training, evaluation, and inference. For example, the training portion of a model function might handle tasks such as defining the topology of a deep neural network and identifying its optimizer function. When using premade Estimators, someone has already written the model function for you. When using custom Estimators, you must write the model function yourself.

For details about writing a model function, see the Creating Custom Estimators chapter in the TensorFlow Programmers Guide.
