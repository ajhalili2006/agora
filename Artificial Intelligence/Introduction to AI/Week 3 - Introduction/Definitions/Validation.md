### validation

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


A process used, as part of training, to evaluate the quality of a machine learning model using the validation set. Because the validation set is disjoint from the training set, validation helps ensure that the modelâ€™s performance generalizes beyond the training set.

Contrast with test set.
