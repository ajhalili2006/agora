	I'd advise those who are embarking on their first AI journey to work with others who have walked the road before them. Be innovative, but don't walk into holes that others could have advised you were there. Partner, collaborate and share. We are better together.
	
#ToDo Make sure at least Daniel has experience in doing something close to what we're doing with a case-study. If not, find someone who has.
