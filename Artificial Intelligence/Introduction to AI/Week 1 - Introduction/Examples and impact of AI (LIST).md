- For a videogame designer, AI means writing the code that affects how bots play, and how the environment reacts to the player.
- For a screenwriter, AI means a character that acts like a human, with some trope of computer features mixed in.
- For a data scientist, AI is a way of exploring and classifying data to meet specific goals. 
- Chatbots powered by natural language processing capabilities, are being used in healthcare to question patients and run basic diagnoses like real doctors.
- In education, they are providing students with easy to learn conversational interfaces and on-demand online tutors.
- Customer service chatbots are improving customer experience by resolving queries on the spot and freeing up agents time for conversations that add value.
- AI-powered advances in speech-to-text technology have made real time transcription a reality.
- Advances in speech synthesis are the reason companies are using AI-powered voice to enhance customer experience, and give their brand its unique voice.
- In the field of medicine, it's helping patients with Lou Gehrig's disease, for example, to regain their real voice in place of using a computerized voice. 
- Computer vision is one of the reasons why cars can steer their way on streets and highways and avoid hitting obstacles.
- Computer vision algorithms detect facial features and images and compare them with databases of face profiles.
- AI is what allows 
	- consumer devices to authenticate the identities of their owners through facial recognition, 
	- social media apps to detect and tag users, and 
	- law enforcement agencies to identify criminals in video feeds.
- AI can aid in detecting cancerous moles in skin images or finding symptoms in x-ray and MRI scan
- There's AI 
	- in our Netflix queue, 
	- our navigation apps, 
	- keeping spam out of our inboxes and 
	- reminding us of important events
- AI is working behind the scenes
	- monitoring our investments, 
	- detecting fraudulent transactions,
	- identifying credit card fraud, and 
	- preventing financial crimes. 

- AI is impacting healthcare in significant ways, by 
	- helping doctors arrive at more accurate preliminary diagnoses,
	- reading medical imaging, 
	- finding appropriate clinical trials for patients, and 
	- making operational processes less expensive. 

- AI has the potential to 
	- access enormous amounts of information, 
	- imitate humans,
	- even specific humans, 
	- make life-changing recommendations about health and finances, and even
	- correlate data that may invade privacy.
