## Modernise your data in the cloud

80% of data is locked in silos and not business-ready. It needs to be modernised onto a single cloud-based platform, apparently. While I'd have to cloud any data to avoid physical infrastructure, take this with a grain of salt and read up on it a little more. See what Google and other platform vendors have to say about this ladder. 

## The four steps on the AI Ladder

1. Collect
2. Organise
3. Analyse
4. Infuse

### Collect

**Make your data simple and accessible**

Collect the data to make it simple and accessible. Really think about the models you need to train and match the way you keep your data to that.

### Organise

**Create a business-ready analytics foundation**

Organize your data to create a business-ready analytics foundation for those AI models. 

### Analyse

**Build and scale AI with trust and explainability**

Analyze your data both for trust and transparency. Because there's no use in applying and scaling AI if you can't explain the outcome, detect bias or prove its accuracy.

### Infuse

**Operationalise your AI throughout your business**

Once you can really trust your data and the AI that you deploy then you can realize its full value inside of the apps and processes that control your everyday work. In other words, the last step is infuse or you begin to operationalize AI throughout your entire business.
