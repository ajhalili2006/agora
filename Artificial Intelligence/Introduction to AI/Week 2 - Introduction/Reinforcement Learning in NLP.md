The 'change vs do nothing' and 'new information vs old information' calculations come into play heavily here. Mainly in terms of determining if a translation requires further information before the current output should be expressed as the answer. 

This is especially important in translating languages like Japanese where the verb comes last, but is required in all langauges as a full sentence is required before its context is fully known.
