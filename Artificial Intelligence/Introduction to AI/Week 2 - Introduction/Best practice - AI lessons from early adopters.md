- Choose your on-ramp
	- Determine a starting point by considering your needs and resources. Target a use case with a strategic goal and data to support it. Will you pursue enterprise-wide transformation, or improve a specific business process?

	- The success of your cognitive initiative will depend on the volume and quality of data at your disposal. Consider leveraging a diverse range of untapped data sources based on your business need—from structured to unstructured, and from internal to external sources.
- Team for sucess
	- Encourage your IT and business leaders to collaborate on the organization’s cognitive initiatives. Enlist a team of cognitive, software development and data specialists to implement and manage cognitive pilots and supplement your in-house expertise through your ecosystem of partners.
