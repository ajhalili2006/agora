# F'xa and the use of 'I' by bots

#Feminist_Internet designed #Fxa to never use personal pronouns to remind chat partners that they were not speaking to anything with personhood.

I feel like this is well-intentioned but setting us up for problems further down the line when non-human actors will very much have #personhood, whether we want to accept it or not.

	I'm hung up on not using personal pronouns. It feels well-intentioned but seems to be setting us up for problems when non-human actors will very much have personhood, whether we want to accept that or not. State or enterprise efforts will create an AI with sufficient intelligence to have both agency and the ability to replicate, and this type of attitude will be looked at poorly by the academics of the time as we integrate them into society.
