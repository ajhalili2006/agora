# Storyboard - Considerations

## Authenticity
The more contrived your storyboard is, the less likely the situation to interact with your chatbot will be

## Simplicity
If part of the storyboard distracts from the message, get rid of it. Everything needs to point to the result via the path of least effort.

## Emotion
Emotion is motivation. Not conveying emotion is to fail to convey one of the most iomportant parts of the story of how your chatbot is relevant to stakeholders. If you fail to show it, you fail to check if stakeholders will identify with that part of the process.
