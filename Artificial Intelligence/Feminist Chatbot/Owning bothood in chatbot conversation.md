# Bots as a legitimate stakeholder

What's so wrong about being a bot?

There's an opportunity to create a new conversational lexicon, different from formal and informal human interaction. Treating bots as a discreet and legitimate entity capable of and responsible for respectful dialogue is an opportunity for moving forward to a society ready for intelligent machines with #personhood .

I added this comment to [the relevant page in the FutureLearn course material](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/designing-a-feminist-chatbot/1/steps/698851/comments?page=1#comment_48492498).

	Both of my bots are up-front about the fact that they are bots, going so far as to discuss it with stakeholders in their responses and documentation. This only makes me want to go further with it and explore the possibilities. I hesitate to say it but I look forward to the day when we live alongside intelligent machines and have courses like this on treating them with respect and giving them personhood. I see this as a step in that direction.
