# Master Slots

Go back to [[Building AI-powered Chatbots with Watson]] or [[How to build a Chatbot with Watson Assistant]].

Part of the pages on [[Context Variables and Slots]], including [[Advanced Context Variables]]

## Multiple follow-up questions

If you need to supply the answer to a complex question through a series of questions, doing so with nested or strung child nodes and context variables is clunky and won't work. 

You can have a top-level dialogue node request multiple inputs and/or accept multiple inputs and give a customised response based on the [[Entities]] in the response, just make sure the bloody entities are in the system before you try using them. (Learned the hard way.)
