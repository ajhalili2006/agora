# Main Library - Chatterbot

## This Library is depreciated

I am no longer using this library but will keep these notes here  for posterity.

See [[Why I didn't use Chatterbot]]

## Links

The [Chatterbot Github page](https://github.com/gunthercox/ChatterBot) has links to most necessary resources.

The main documentation can be found at the [Chatterbot Readthedocs page](https://chatterbot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)

There is a seperate Github page for the [Chatterbot language training Corpus](https://github.com/gunthercox/chatterbot-corpus) as well.

## Notes on using this library

- It will do for now. It seems easy to use but also out-of-date already. 
- I'll need to use the Ubuntu Corpus as soon as I can figure out how to.
- This is just a stop-gap until I can get PyTorch and Bert working.
- Which will just be a stop-gap until I can get GPT-2 working alongside PT and Bert.
- This thing is 2 years old. Get it running for now and then actively seek a better option asap.
