	 - Celebrities & food
 - Can create custom classifiers quickly
 - Not good for real-time video
 - Scalable, but expensive

### OpenCV

 - Python package
 - Comes with pre-packaged modules
	 - Faces, eyes
 - Can create custom classifiers, but with more difficulty
 - Can handle real-time videos
 - Learning curve
 - Bugs, but free
