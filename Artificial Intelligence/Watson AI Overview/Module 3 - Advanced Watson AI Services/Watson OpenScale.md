## Scenario

Let's take an insurance company that's using AI to process claims. The system suggests rejecting
an applicant who seems to tick all the boxes. How can the claims process understand why? 

- An explainability feature enables them to get detailed answers in terms anyone can understand, should customers or regulators ask. 
- Traceability lets them retrace the process step-by-step right back to the documents and data the AI drew from. 
- If harmful bias has swayed an outcome, a bias feature pinpoints how it occurred and automatically mitigates it.
