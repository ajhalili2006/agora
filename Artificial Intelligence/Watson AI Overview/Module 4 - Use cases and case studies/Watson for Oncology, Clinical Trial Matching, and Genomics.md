Each day, leaders, advocates, andinfluencers in health makepowerful progress toward a healthier future.IBM Watson Oncology solutions can helpaccelerate access to careby removing unnecessary barriers.Improve care providers connectionsto essential knowledge,provide information to help enhanceevidence and clarity for clinicians as theyconsider care decisions to helpyou achieve accelerated discovery,essential connections, heightened competence.We do this by providing a suiteof solutions for your practice.

Watson for Oncology can help you createevidence-based patient-centric treatment regimens.

As your healthcare system grows to includemore doctors, teams, and locations,the regimens you rely on todefine treatment approaches may be shared inconsistently, informed by the wrong information,or not aligned with the latest research.Watson for Oncology can helpidentify and reduce variability by providingyour clinicians with information regardingevidence-based patient-centric treatment options,with dynamically curated contentacross guidelines, trials, articles, and patient data.

Watson for Oncology can help bring your clinical teamsvaluable and relevant information regardingthe clinical approaches that are atthe forefront of the industry.Each and every patient now walking intoour cancer center go through the Watson for Oncology.When I go through the outcome andthe recommendation and the evidence,I'm not missing anything for my patient.This is something which is going to throwup very high-level evidence,personalized medicine at a very short time to my patient.This makes me very reassuring that I'm up-to-date.It's cognitive intuitive goingto take care of everything ofthe patient without overlooking or making any errors.

Watson Clinical Trial matching can help quicklyidentify clinical trials forthe treating physicians consideration.Clinical trials still requiresignificant time to evaluate open trials,analyze enrollment criteria, anddetermine which patients fit which study.

It can be difficult to identify the trialsyour patients may be eligible for.With Watson for Clinical Trial Matching,we can help eliminate the need to manuallyanalyze complex enrollment criteria.

Which means you can help identifypatients and present their treating clinicians withtrial options with greater easeand efficiency. What's more,you'll be able to automatically summarize patient's medical records,comparing relevant characteristicsto current protocols toquickly determine which trialsare best for which patients.You could conceive of Watson could screen notonly for our local trials, but trials nationally.I would note that whatour current practices screening every patient every dayis a time consuming process and wewould save a lot of time using the Watson Platform.

Watson for Genomics can help scalethe power of precision medicine at your practice.The time and effort required tolocate information relevant tothe genetic profile of a tumor samplecan be a hindrance and your path to progress,and relying on cumbersome manual processesthat can be prone to errors biases and delays.

This analysis can undermineyour program's effectiveness and scale.With Watson for Genomics,you can help mitigatethese concerns and streamline your process.With information that integrates thousands ofrelevant articles and providespatient-centric therapeutic options.You'll be able to obtain information to helpclinicians analyze genetic testing results,and make decisions abouttheir patients personalized treatment plan.

The beauty and the value of Watson for Genomics is that it helps providersmake sense of the enormous amount ofmolecular information that isavailable about their patients tumors,it makes that information available quickly,and it surfaces the right insights that help them makethe treatment decisions that need to bemade for the patient at the point of care.There are countless examples now wherethis kind of information is trulychanging the lives of cancer patients.That's the power of Watson for Genomics.
