**Transcript**
In 2011 an IBM cognitive system won Jeopardy. Now cognitive systems
are tackling business challenges as varied as operations and healthcare.
Let's see how IBM Watson is helping elevator engineers.
Hello my name is Watson, greetings from the top of Q1 tower. 
You might be wondering how I got here,
I did not climb the 1331 stairs in this skyscraper.
Instead I took an elevator operated by Kone.
Everyday Kone helps to transport approximately one billion elevator and
escalator passengers throughout the world.
And I am working with them to help ensure smoothness with every ride.
Elevators are being equipped with IOT sensors that connect to the IBM
cloud which I can analyze for wear and tear, bumpy rides and
the smallest misalignments.
I can immediately alert maintenance crews of any issues via their smartphones,
provide probable causes and solutions and help them run tests remotely.
With this information along with data from structured and
unstructured sources, I can prioritize jobs and
help technicians continue providing a great passenger experience.
With my help, engineers are fixing potential problems before they happen.
Working together that can help Kone service technicians speed up repairs and
make rides smoother.
This lowers your chances of spending too much time in an elevator with a co-
worker, I have heard that can be awkward.

>> From the big city to a rural doctor's office, Watson can help. 
>> So you miss the big city? 
>> I don't miss much, definitely not the traffic. 
>> Excuse me, doctor, the genomic data came in. 
>> Thank you. 
>> You can do that kind of analysis? 
>> Yeah, Watson. 
>> I can quickly analyze millions of clinical and scientific reports to help 
you tailor treatment options for the patient's genomic profile.
>> You can do that, even way out here? 
>> Yes, even way out here. 
>> Watson and AI can be part of a wide range of business ventures, 
wherever you are.
