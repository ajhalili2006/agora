## Company: Insurance in general

Betweena analysing policy data and searching customer histories for reasons not to pay out, there's a lot of scraped data through which to sort.

[Watson Explorer](https://www.ibm.com/us-en/marketplace/content-analytics) can search through and make sense of a knowledgebase and make recommendations on whether a claim is eligable and how much should be paid.

## Impact

From IBM:

	Now employees of insurance companies are assessing claims 25% faster.
	
- A customer files a claim.
- Employees collect relevant information about the incident.
- Employees input this information into their system.
- Watson works behind the scenes with employees to help determine claim eligibility and the percentage that should be paid.
- Employees use a tab to access Watsonâ€™s recommendation and decide how to best proceed with payment.
- Employees assess claims more efficiently, saving hours of time each month.
