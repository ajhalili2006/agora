## Cultural considerations with AI

It's not enough just to #translate a #language when it comes to #internationalisation.

From IBM:

	“It’s more than just learning the language,” said IBM Managing Director Katia Vaskys. “You also need to understand Brazil’s culture, and the regional accents, and the way each region asks a question.”
	

## How Watson learned, in five steps:

### 1. Watson was trained.

In Portuguese and in banking by a dedicated team with 10,000 customer questions.

### 2. Watson was tested.

In a limited number of branches until the bank was satisfied with the responses.

### 3. Watson was launched.

And made available to the employees of all 5,200 branches nationwide.

### 4. Watson got results.

And as employees began to trust Watson, response times were reduced from 10 minutes to a few seconds.

### 5. Watson keeps learning.

And improving, thanks to feedback on over 10 million interactions.

## Training times and requirements

From IBM:

	“Yes, Watson can learn,” said one IBMer, “but it needs people to teach people who are committed and patient.” Because of this team effort, Watson could understand 100% of written questions and 83% of spoken ones after just 5 months of training. And after 10 months, the system was answering 96% of all questions correctly.

## Business Impact

From IBM:

	Now Watson is trained on 62 products and answers 283,000 questions a month with a 95% accuracy rate, with just 5% requiring calls for further assistance. In some cases, response times have been reduced from 10 minutes to just seconds. “It’s a real wow factor,” exclaimed one manager.
