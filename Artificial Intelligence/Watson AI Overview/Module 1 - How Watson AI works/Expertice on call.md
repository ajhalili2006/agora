## Company: Humana

Industry: Insurance

[One of the companies](https://www.ibm.com/watson/stories/humana/) that essentially paid for the initial research into voice assistant AI capabilities for Watson. Indeed **this is the case:**

	Humana's Voice Assistant solution pattern recently became formalized in the Watson Assistant for Voice Interaction solution offering.

**Operating costs** were a third of the existing system.

It also doubled the **response rate** of the previous system.

Used a small call centre to train improvements before pushing to the broader system.

	The solution receives more than 7,000 voice calls from 120 providers per business day.
