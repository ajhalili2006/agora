# Watson with Audits and Compliance

Go back to [[Module 1 - Watson AI Overview]] or the [[Main AI Page]]

Watson can be used for business processes such as those used for compliance and auditing.

This is why AI must be **explainable**, if you cannot show how you arrived at a result, you cannot use it as part of a business, legal, or academic process.

AI can also theoratically deal with the calculations required for the complexity of multi-jurisdictional laws and be trained.

Unlike normal computer systems, AI can get into the unstructured text to find deeper meanings and causes, such as in incident reports and contracts.

## AI can be the solution to needing Federalism

You can't throw enough people at the problem of disparate regulatory systems to fix it, you need an AI to advise people on it.

With AI you can have as many small communities with different regulatory systems as you like but still have them able to interact because AIs will be able to understand and navigate through those complexities in ways humans can't.
