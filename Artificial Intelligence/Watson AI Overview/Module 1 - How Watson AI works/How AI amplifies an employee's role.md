“I want technology to do what technology does, which is keep expanding our capabilities. Because when you do that, you expand not only the capabilities to sell a book or to search, but you also expand the capabilities to teach, to learn, to lift people up faster”

A [McKinsey Institute study](https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/future-of-work/jobs-lost-jobs-gained-what-the-future-of-work-will-mean-for-jobs-skills-and-wages) found that more than half of the 2,000 jobs studied could streamline 30% or more of their tedious responsibilities with AI. 

## Don't miss the needle in the haystack

At KPMG, missing one detail in the enormous tax codes they deal with around the world could mean millions of dollars in lost revenue.

## Inter-species communication is best communication

AI in the workplace is about enhancing productivity by augmenting employees and allowing them to build stronger relationships with clients. [With IBM forecasting](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2018/10/what-did-your-business-learn-last-night-3-ways-watson-ai-enables-employees-to-work-at-the-speed-of-data-and-do-more-interesting-work/) that by  2022, one in five employees will have an AI “colleague” on their team. 

Crédit Mutuel, one of France’s leading banks, empowers client advisors to [maintain quality client relationships by applying AI](https://www.ibm.com/watson/stories/creditmutuel/) to get answers to customer questions faster.

With AI, advisors now answer customer questions 60% faster, strengthening customer relationships in 5,000 branches.

[Insurance company Humana](https://www.ibm.com/watson/stories/humana/) was able to lift their phone system's sinking reputation and performance out of the swamp when they helped create the voice system that is now Watson's Voice Assistant, doubling their response rate in the process.

Brazillian banking company [Bradasco challenged Watson](https://www.ibm.com/watson/stories/bradesco/) to learn not only the language of their customers, but the many and varied cultures as well. Once they had, though, only 5% of calls required human assistance.

## AI can span the generations in a way they haven't themselves

Boomers, Millennials, Gen Z—not to mention the Silents and Gen Xers—are [all active in today’s workplace](https://www.ibm.com/blogs/watson/2018/10/what-did-your-business-learn-last-night-3-ways-watson-ai-enables-employees-to-work-at-the-speed-of-data-and-do-more-interesting-work/).
