1. First, it comes pre-trained with industry-relevant content.
2. The second is that, it remembers and understands user input. For example, your customer's having a conversation with Watson and Watson recognizes a new intent, Watson needs to answer that question and remember this conversation just as you would expect a human to remember.
3. Third, it recommends. Watson assesses what is happening in these conversations and recommends places that may be strengthened by having other intents. When you provide a few example of questions, intents, and clarifying terms, entities. Watson Assistant can build a machine learning model to understand similar natural language requests from your users.
