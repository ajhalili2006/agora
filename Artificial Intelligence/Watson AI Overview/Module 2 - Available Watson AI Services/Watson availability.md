From IBM:

	Watson was initially available only on IBM cloud, but is now portable across any cloud powered business. Organizations can now run IBM Watson services  including Watson Assistant, and Watson Open Scale on any cloud public or  private. This prevents customers being locked into a single vendor and enables them to start deploying AI wherever their data resides. With Watson, you can discover new trends and insights. Predict the potential future outcomes. Leverage these findings to automate aspects of your application, product, service, or business allowing you to focus on making decisions.
