# Badass Latin Threat

This came from a game of [[Diplomacy Games|Diplomacy]] where I was allied with truly excellent German and Russian players.

The Italians had promised peace but used it to attack me to the north. Without the help of Germany I would have been crushed while I quickly pressured Turkey to the south with Russia.

## The threat

In Latin:

> Perfidiae ad infernum.
> Gladius meus praecedere.

In English:

> Treachery leads to hell.
> My sword shall precede it.
