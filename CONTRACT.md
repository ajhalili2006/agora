An Agora is defined by its code of conduct; it is a contract that binds us within its confines. It is therefore of utmost importance for it to be well specified (explicit) and understandable by all.

A [[contract]] is just a list of [[assertions]]: a thorough declaration of [[intents]]. This is one such list; it is chronically incomplete by its very nature. Please feel free to contribute corrections (we accept [[git]] [[prs]]!) -- or guidance in the form of feedback.

- Be honest.
- When interacting with others, either directly or indirectly, please keep in mind and follow the [[principle of charity]].
- Try to be [[constructive]], [[kind]], [[rational]], and [[compassionate]].
- When you disagree with someone, please prioritize mutual understanding over winning an argument.
- If you made a mistake, apologize.
- If someone made a mistake but then apologized thoroughly and made [[amendments]] or [[reparations]], try to love them for that. Be mindful of the importance of [[forgiveness]].

Feel free to follow your extension of any well defined set of values. If you have personal [[contract]], please upload it to the [[agora]] in this or any well marked node. 
  - See [[agora client]] or reach out to [[flancian]], [[vera]], [[bmann]], or any other of the member of the [[fedstoa]] if you'd like to get involved.

(The members of an [[agora]] can propose changes to its [[contract]] by reaching out to its [maintainers](https://anagora.org/node/fedstoa) or directly sending a [[pr]].

E pluribus unum; per aspera ad astra.
