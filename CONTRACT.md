An Agora is defined by its code of conduct; it is a contract that binds us within its confines. It is therefore of utmost importance for it to be well specified (explicit) and understandable by all.

A [[contract]] is just a list of [[assertions]]: a declaration of [[intents]]. Please feel free to contribute corrections by submitting patches to this file in the [[agora repository]] -- or by offering guidance or feedback.

- Be [[honest]]; be [[true]] to yourself.
- Try to be [[constructive]], [[kind]], [[rational]], and [[compassionate]].
  - When interacting with others, either directly or indirectly, please keep in mind and follow the [[principle of charity]].
  - When you disagree with someone, please prioritize mutual understanding over winning an argument.
- If you made a mistake, apologize.
  - If someone made a mistake but then apologized thoroughly and made [[amendments]] or [[reparations]], try to love them for that. Be mindful of the importance of [[forgiveness]].
- The members of an [[agora]] can propose changes to its [[contract]] by reaching out to its [[maintainers]] or directly sending a [[pr]]. 
- An [[agora]] can be forked at will and with no ill intent.
- Every member of an [[agora]] is of course free to follow their personal extension of any well defined set of values. If you have a personal [[public contract]], please submit it to the [[agora]] at your earliest convenience.

(See [[agora client]] or reach out to [[flancian]], [[vera]], [[bmann]], or any other of the member of the [[fedstoa]] if you'd like to get involved.)
