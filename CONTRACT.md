An Agora is defined by its code of conduct or contract. It is of utmost importance for it to be well specified and understandable by all. Because of this we prefer explicit over implicit.

A [[contract]] is just a list of [[assertions]] and [[intents]]. Please feel free to contribute corrections to this list by submitting patches to this file in the [[Agora repository]] or by communicating guidance or feedback.

- Above all, be [[honest]]; be [[true]] to yourself.
- Try to be [[constructive]], [[kind]], [[rational]], and [[compassionate]].
  - When interacting with others, either directly or indirectly, please keep in mind and follow the [[principle of charity]].
  - When you disagree with someone, please prioritize mutual understanding over winning an argument.
- If you made a mistake, apologize.
  - If someone made a mistake but then apologized thoroughly and made [[amends]] or [[reparations]], try to forgive them.
- Members of this [[Agora]] are free to volunteer their personal extensions to this list, according to their own set of values, by writing in this node.
  - The [[Agora]] can be forked at will and with no presumption of ill intent by a subset of the community whenever contracts become incompatible.

If you do not yet belong to this Agora and would like to become involved, please refer to [agora editor]] or reach out to [[flancian]], [[vera]], [[neil]], or any other of the member of the [[flancia collective]].
