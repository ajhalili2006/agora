Ahoy, matey!

Welcome to an [[Agora]] v.0.5.4.

 This site is very much under construction, but feel free to look around! 
 
- [/nodes](/nodes) lists all non-journal nodes in this Agora; a node is the set of all subnodes with a given title, or otherwise about the same entity. Subnodes can come from a variety of sources; currently these are mostly notes as volunteered by users.
- [/journals](/journals) displays all journal entries (these are just nodes matching YYYY-MM-DD).
- [/users](/users) displays all users in this Agora. Click through to see their subnodes.
- [/latest](/latest) shows which subnodes were added or modified recently.
- [/search](/search) offers full text search over all subnodes (supports regexes).

The [[wikilink]] is the heart of the [[agora protocol]]. In an Agora, [[foo]] will resolve to every subnode that identifies with entity 'foo'; by default, every file titled ```foo.md`` in its collection of [[digital gardens]]. You can think of an Agora node distributed, collaboratively built, sequential wiki page. Nodes assemble into a [[distributed knowledge graph]].

If you're interested in knowing what's coming to the Agora, please refer to [[agora plan]]. 

If you'd like to join this Agora, please refer to [[agora help]]. 

Have a nice day!
