# Welcome to the Agora

Ahoy there!

This [[Agora]], which is just one of many, is very much under active development; but feel free to look around!
 
- [/nodes](/nodes) lists all non-journal nodes in this Agora; a node is the set of all subnodes with a given title, or otherwise mapping to a single [[entity]]. Subnodes can come from a variety of sources; currently these are mostly notes as volunteered by users via their independent digital gardens.
- [/journals](/journals) displays all journal entries (these are subnodes whose filenames look like dates, such as YYYY-MM-DD).
- [/users](/users) displays all users in this Agora. Click through to see their subnodes (gardens).
- [/latest](/latest) shows which subnodes were added or modified recently.
- [/search](/search) lets you search in all nodes (supports regexes).

The [[wikilink]] is the heart of the [[Agora protocol]]. In the context of an Agora, [[foo]] will resolve to every subnode that identifies with entity 'foo'; by default, every file titled ```foo.md``` in its collection of [[digital gardens]]. You can think of an Agora node as a distributed, collaboratively built, sequential wiki page. Nodes assemble into a [[distributed knowledge graph]].

This Agora is running [[agora server]]. If you're interested in knowing what's coming next, please refer to [[agora plan]]. 

If you'd like to join this Agora, please refer to [[agora help]]. 

Have a nice day!
