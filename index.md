# Welcome to the [[Agora]]!

Ahoy there!

**This [[Agora]] is a [[wiki like]] [[experimental social network]] and [[distributed knowledge graph]].**
 
- [/nodes](/nodes) lists all [[pages]] in this Agora.
  - A [[node]] is the set of all notes and resources with a given title or otherwise mapping to an [[entity description]]. Subnodes (blocks) in a node can come from a variety of sources; they are resources volunteered by Agora users through their independent [[repositories]]. As of August 2021, these are mostly notes from [[digital gardens]].
  - [/latest](/latest) shows nodes by modification time.
- [/users](/users) displays all users in this Agora. Click through to see their contributions.
  - [/journals](/journals) displays all subnodes that *look like* they belong to a daily entry (these are subnodes whose filenames look like dates, such as `YYYY-MM-DD`).

The [[wikilink]] is the heart of this [[Agora]]: wikilinks serve as a tool to indicate a social [[context]] assembled out of individual and group contributions. In this Agora, [[foo bar]] will resolve to ***every resource*** that identifies with entity 'foo'; in particular, currently every file named ```foo-bar.md```, ```foo-bar.jpg```, ```foo-bar.png```, etc. An Agora tries to best-effort integrate user contributions while preserving meaning and volunteering interesting information. You can also think of it as a [[sequential wiki]].

**If you'd like to join this Agora, please refer to [[agora signup]]. If you'd like to run your own Agora, please refer to [[agora install]] and/or reach out to [[flancian]], the maintainer.**

If you're interested in knowing what's coming next, please refer to [[agora plan]] or join [[flancia collective]].

Have a nice day!
