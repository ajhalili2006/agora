# Welcome to the Agora of Flancia!

This [[Agora]] is a <strong>Free Knowledge Commons</strong> provisioned by a community for the benefit of sentient beings.

## Getting started

An <strong>Agora node</strong> presents an aggregated view of resources that are relevant for a query or location. 

An <strong>Agora user</strong> is anyone who has contributed resources, either as part of a repository or as individual social media posts.

A quick tour will drive the point home better than a thousand words. To start navigating:

- You can browse all [[Nodes]] and [[Users]].
- You can visit the node called [[Index]] to see the community-maintained index of this Agora.
- You can visit [[Journals]] for an aggregated view of resources that seem time-related -- i.e. a timeline :).
- You can visit [[Random]] for a random node -- it can be fun!

## Joining

The Agora is a bit different from most other sites in that joining is a two step process that begins elsewhere in the internet :) Thank you for your understanding.

- You can write to this Agora from the [[Fediverse]] (federated social media) by following and interacting with an [[Agora Bot]] such as <https://botsin.space/@agora>.
- You can send us a [[pull request]] adding your git repository (containing a digital garden, wiki or blog) to this Agora's [[sources.yaml]] -- <strong>or, if you don't know what any of that means</strong>, reach out to @[flancian](https://anagora.org/flancian) or another member of [Flancia Collective](https://anagora.org/flancia-collective) to support you through the process :)

## On the purpose of the Agora project

The Agora began back in [2017](https://flancia.org/agora) as a thought experiment: we set out to try to make use of parts of the existing internet in novel ways to solve socially relevant [[coordination problems]]. With time, we developed free software to support this goal and help communities run their own Agoras as digital spaces.

The Agora can be described in a variety of ways, and we have done so extensively (and occasionally contradictorily!) in writing which can be found in this [[Agora]] proper and also in a more traditional [published format](https://anagora.org/agora+chapter). Through years of research the one concept that has come the closest to summarizing the intent behind the Agora is that of the [[Commons]], which is why we used it in our welcome above. More concretely, in its current shape the Agora can be described as a [[distributed knowledge graph]] assembled from the self-hosted writing of [[users]] -- a sort of loosely-coupled wiki where each page is made up of independent fragments expressing individual viewpoints.

Beyond these humble beginnings, the greater aspirational goal of the Agora project remains: <strong>to integrate and complement the constructive parts of the internet</strong>, helping us "hold it right" (it being the powerful and potentially risky tool that it is), both for the benefit of communities running Agoras and that of wider society.
