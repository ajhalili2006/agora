# Welcome to the Agora of Flancia!

This is an [Agora](https://flancia.org/agora) -- a public space and <strong>Free Knowledge Commons</strong> built by the people, for the people.

Which people, you ask? Us [[Flancians]] -- and our friends!

## Dive in

Some interesting locations to start at:

- See the list of [[Users]] contributing to this Agora.
- See the list of all [[Nodes]] which includes a large dynamic graph of the Agora (might crash your browser).
- Visit [[Journals]] for a timeline of resources that seem journal-like.
- Visit [[Random]] for a random node.

Or just type anything on the search bar above :) You will be sent to the <strong>Agora Node</strong> view for the matching location.

Please [[reach out]] if you need anything, enjoy the Agora, and have a great day :)!

## To join

You can write to this Agora from the [[Fediverse]] (social media) using an [[Agora Bot]]; or you can join as a full user by contributing your self-hosted writing. For the latter, please read on.

You will need to send a [[PR]] adding a pointer to your digital garden as a git repository to [[sources.yaml]] -- or, if you don't know what that means, please reach out to @[flancian](https://anagora.org/flancian) or another member of [Flancia Collective](https://anagora.org/flancia-collective) to discuss what is needed to let us find (and import continuously) your content from around internet. 

Please indicate your preferred username and your acceptance of the instance's [[CONTRACT]] as of the time of writing. ***If you contribute your repository to an Agora you are assumed to be in agreement with its current [[CONTRACT]] as posted by user @agora.*** 

Your repository, once integrated, will appear live at [[users]], and compatible resources (like Markdown notes and graphics) will be surfaced in relevant locations around the Agora.

## Agora architecture

See [[Agora architecture]] for details on how the Agora works and how you can run your own.
