# Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]!

An [Agora](https://flancia.org/agora) is a [[Free Knowledge Commons]] built by the people, for the people.

Which people, you ask? In the case of this Agora: us [[Flancians]] -- for our friends!

# Navigating

An [[Agora]] is a "new" type of website -- you can think of it as a giant [[wiki]] assembled from resources contributed by its users, either as repositories ([[digital gardens]], [[wikis]], [[knowledge bases]], etc.) or as individual posts (from [[blogs]] or [[social networks]]).

Contributed resources are usually shown in some order with clear attribution whenever you visit an [[Agora Location]], or [[Node]] for short. 

It's probably a good idea to click around and see what you find. You can see the full list of [[nodes]] available in this Agora by clicking on this link or scrolling down.

Have fun! :)
