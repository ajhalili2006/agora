# Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]!

This *[Agora](https://flancia.org/agora)* is a [[Free]] [[Knowledge]] [[Commons]] built for the benefit of beings.

# Navigating

A quick tour of the Agora might be the best way to communicate its underlying goals and intentions.

- A <strong>Node</strong> is the set of community contributions whose titles match the Agora location (i.e. what you searched for). 
    - You can start by seeing the list of all [[Nodes]] in this Agora.
    - Or visit node [[Index]], included below; it is the community-maintained index of this Agora, which is richer and more diverse than this one.
    - Or visit special location [[Random]] which will send you to a random node out of the many thousands gathered so far.
- A <strong>User</strong> is anyone who has contributed resources to the Commons, either as part of a repository or individually through social media.
  - You can see the list of all [[Users]] and the nodes they've contributed to.

# Joining

This <strong>Agora</strong> is a bit different from most other sites around the internet in that joining is a **two step process** that begins somewhere else: First you take notes/write/make posts in the editor(s) or platform(s) of your choice, and then you tell an Agora that you'd like to contribute these resources to the Commons.

## Contributing your personal notes and other writing

You can contribute to this Agora by taking notes using an app like [[Obsidian]], [[Logseq]] or [[SilverBullet]]; storing them in a [[git]] repository; and telling the Agora about them by writing to <signup@anagora.org> with the location of your repository, your desired username and whether you accept the code of conduct available at [[CONTRACT]].

## Posting from social media

You can write to this Agora straight from social media! To do so, you need to follow an [[Agora Bot]] in a supported platform and post following a convention.

- If you are in Mastodon or more generally in the Fediverse, you can follow <https://social.agor.ai/@agora>.
- If you are in [[Bluesky]], you can follow anagora.bsky.social.

Then write posts containing at least one [[wikilink]]; they will be linked in the mentioned nodes. You can opt into full message writing and #hashtag handling by [[opting in]] once.

## For more‚Ä¶

- See [[Agora chapter]] for a ~20 page description of the vision behind the Agora project and what we have accomplished as of the time of writing (2023).
- See [[Agora architecture]] for some details on how the Agora works and instructions to run your own.

Please reach out to [[@flancian]] if you need anything, enjoy the Agora, and have a great day! üçÆ
