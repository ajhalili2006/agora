# Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]!

The *[Agora](https://flancia.org/agora)* is a free knowledge *[[Commons]]* built by people for the benefit of others.

Which people, you ask? 

In the case of this particular Agora: us [[Flancians]] -- and our [[friends]]!

# Navigating

A quick tour of the Agora will communicate the intentions behind the project better than many words in this small index :)

- See the list of all [[Nodes]], see the [[Users]] who contributed them.
  - A <strong>Node</strong> is an aggregated view of resources that are relevant for a query or location. 
  - A <strong>User</strong> is a *Commoner*, meaning anyone who has contributed resources to the Commons, either as part of a repository or as social media posts.
- See node [[Index]] for the community-maintained index of this Agora, which is richer than this one, and will be transcluded ("pulled") for you below.
- See special node [[Journals]] for an aggregated view of journal entries and other resources that seem relevant in a time context.
- See special node [[Random]] for a random node out of the many thousands gathered so far.
  - Warning: could be addictive :).

# Joining

This <strong>Agora</strong> is a bit different from most other sites around the internet in that joining is a **two step process** that begins elsewhere :) 

In a nutshell: first you take notes/write/make posts in the platform(s) of your choice; and then you tell the Agora that you'd like to contribute those resources to the <strong>Commons</strong>.

## Contributing notes and free form writing

You can write to this Agora by taking notes using a [[personal knowledge management]] system like e.g. [[Obsidian]], [[Logseq]] or [[SilverBullet]], storing them in a repository, and telling us about it by writing to <signup@anagora.org> or reaching out over any of the other supported [[Agora channels]].

If you are "tech-savvy" (in this particular way) you can send a [[pull request]] adding your [[git]] repository to this Agora's [[sources.yaml]] specifying the username of your choice. <strong>If you can't make this work or even if you don't know what any of that means</strong> please [[reach out]] if interested so we can try to support you through the process :)

## Posting from social media

You can write to this Agora straight from the [[Fediverse]] (meaning distributed social media, e.g. [[Mastodon]])! To do so, follow the [[Agora Bot]] at <https://botsin.space/@agora> and interact with it.

'Interacting' here means writing posts containing at least one [[wikilink]], or opting in to #hashtag handling. Your posts will be linked and optionally cross-posted in text format to the matching Agora location.

- See [[Agora chapter]] for a ~20 page description of the vision behind the Agora and what we have accomplished so far, being the draft of a book chapter published in 2023.
- Please [[reach out]] if you need anything, enjoy the Agora, and have a great day! üçÆ
