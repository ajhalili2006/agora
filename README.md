# Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]!

This [Agora](https://flancia.org/agora) is a free [[Knowledge Commons]] built by the people, for the people.

Which people, you may wonder? Us [[Flancians]] -- and our friends!

# Navigating

A quick tour will drive the point home better than a thousand words.

- You can browse all [[Nodes]] and the [[Users]] who contributed them.
  - An <strong>Agora node</strong> is an aggregated view of resources that are relevant for a query or location. 
  - An <strong>Agora user</strong> is anyone who has contributed resources, either as part of a repository or as individual (e.g. social media) posts.
- You can visit the node called [[Index]] to see the community-maintained index of this Agora, which is richer than this one.
- You can visit [[Journals]] for an aggregated view of journal entries and other resources that seem time-related.
- You can check out special node [[Random]] for a random node :)

# Joining

The <strong>Agora</strong> is a bit different from most other sites around the internet in that joining is a two step process that begins elsewhere :) First you take notes or make posts in the platform(s) of your choice; and then you tell an Agora that you'd like to contribute those resources to the <strong>Commons</strong>.

## Contributing your notes

You can write to this Agora by taking notes using a [[personal knowledge management]] system like e.g. [[Obsidian]], [[Logseq]] or [[SilverBullet]], storing them in a repository, and telling us about it.

If you are tech-savvy in this way you can send us a [[pull request]] adding your git repository to this Agora's [[sources.yaml]] -- <strong>or, if you can't make it work or don't know what that means</strong>, you can reach out to @[flancian](https://anagora.org/flancian) or another member of [Flancia Collective](https://anagora.org/flancia-collective) to support you through the process :)

## Posting from social media

You can write in a limited form to this Agora straight from from the [[Fediverse]] (a.k.a. 'Mastodon', distributed social media) by following an [[Agora Bot]] such as <https://botsin.space/@agora>.

'Interacting' here means first following them and then writing posts containing at least one [[wikilink]]. Your posts will be linked and optionally cross-posted to the matching location.

## For more‚Ä¶

See [[Agora architecture]] for details on how the Agora works and instructions to run your own.

See [[Agora chapter]] for a ~20 page description of the vision behind the Agora and what we have accomplished so far.

Please reach out if you need anything, enjoy the Agora, and have a great day! üçÆ
