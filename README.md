# Welcome to the Agora of Flancia!

An [Agora](https://flancia.org/agora) is a <strong>public space</strong> and <strong>Free Knowledge Commons</strong> built by the people, for the people.

Which people, you ask? Us [[Flancians]] -- and our friends!

## To join


You will need to send a [[PR]] adding a pointer to your git repository containing a digital garden or blog to [[sources.yaml]] -- or, if you don't know what that means, please reach out to @[flancian](https://anagora.org/flancian) or another member of [Flancia Collective](https://anagora.org/flancia-collective) to discuss what is needed to let us find (and import continuously) your content from around internet. 

Please indicate your preferred username and your acceptance of the instance's [[CONTRACT]] as of the time of writing. ***If you contribute your repository to an Agora you are assumed to be in agreement with its current [[CONTRACT]] as posted by user @agora.***
