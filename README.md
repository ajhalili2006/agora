# An Agora
A possible implementation of the Agora (flancia.org/agora).

For now, (https://anagora.org) represents the v1 of the Agora. It is a vanilla MediaWiki install; soon it might get semantic extensions to better model the knowledge graphs we need to get started having constructive debates and solving problems cooperatively.
