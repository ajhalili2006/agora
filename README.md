# Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]!

The *[Agora](https://flancia.org/agora)* is a free knowledge *[[Commons]]* built by the people, for the people.

Which people, you ask? 

In the case of this particular Agora: us [[Flancians]] -- for our [[friends]]!

# Navigating

A quick tour of the Agora will hopefully communicate the intentions of the project better than many words of introduction.

- You can see the list of all [[Nodes]] and the the [[Users]] who contributed them.
  - A <strong>Node</strong> is an aggregated view of resources that are relevant for a query or location. 
  - A <strong>User</strong> is anyone who has contributed resources to the Commons, either as part of an Agora repository or through social media.
- See node [[Index]] for the community-maintained index of this Agora, which is richer than this one, and will be embedded/transcluded/pulled for you below.
- See special node [[Journals]] for an aggregated view of journal entries and other resources that seem relevant in a time context.
- See special node [[Random]] for a random node out of the many thousands gathered so far.
  - Warning: could be addictive :).

# Joining

This <strong>Agora</strong> is a bit different from most other sites around the internet in that joining is a **two step process** that begins somewhere else.

In a nutshell, it is a two step process: 
- First you take notes/write/make posts in the editor(s) or platform(s) of your choice.
- Then you tell an Agora that you'd like to contribute those resources.

## Contributing notes and free form writing

You can write to this Agora by taking notes using a [[personal knowledge management]] system like [[Obsidian]], [[Logseq]] or [[SilverBullet]], storing them in a repository, and telling us about it by writing to <signup@anagora.org> or reaching out over any of the other supported [[Agora channels]].

If you are "tech-savvy" (in this particular way) you can send a [[pull request]] adding your [[git]] repository to this Agora's [[sources.yaml]] specifying the username of your choice. <strong>If you can't make this work or even if you don't know what any of that means</strong> please [[reach out]] if interested so we can try to support you through the process :)

## Posting from social media

You can write to this Agora straight from the [[Fediverse]]! To do so, follow the [[Agora Bot]] in a supported platform.

- If you are in Mastodon/ActivityPub, you can follow <https://botsin.space/@agora>.
- If you are in [[Bluesky]], you can do the same with https://anagora.bsky.social.

'Interacting' here means writing posts containing at least one [[wikilink]], or opting in to #hashtag handling. Your posts will be linked and optionally cross-posted in text format to the matching Agora location.

- See [[Agora chapter]] for a ~20 page description of the vision behind the Agora and what we have accomplished so far, being the draft of a book chapter published in 2023.
- Please [[reach out]] if you need anything, enjoy the Agora, and have a great day! üçÆ
