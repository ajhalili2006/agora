# Welcome to the Agora v0.5
This is v0.5 of the [Agora](flancia.org/agora). You can find the v0 online (but currently unmaintained) at <anagora.org>; the Agora v0.5 is expected to replace it eventually.

# What's an Agora?

An [Agora](https://anagora.org/wiki/Agora) is a distributed, goal-oriented social network based on a cooperatively built and maintained knowledge graph -- a collection of digital gardens.

The Agora comes with a default narrative: the Agora is a virtual place assembled from fragments of our internet. This repository points to many such places.

## Who builds the Agora?

The Agoreans build the Agora :) An Agorean is any entity that is interested in building or maintaining an Agora, and is willing to uphold and preserve its Code of Conduct.

## Code of Conduct

For now, please refer to the relevant section in the [Agora v0](https://anagora.org/wiki/Main_Page).

# Places in this Agora

 - Gardens: a collection of digital gardens from participating users (currently being built).
 - Stoa: a place in which to engage in meaningful, constructive, civil, charitable discussion (planned).
