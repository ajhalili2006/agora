# Welcome to the [[Agora of Flancia]]!

This *[Agora](https://flancia.org/agora)* is a [[Free]] [[Knowledge]] [[Commons]] built for the benefit of beings.

# Navigating

A quick tour of the Agora might be the best way to communicate its underlying goals and the core concepts behind it:

- A <strong>Node</strong> is the set of community contributions whose titles match an Agora location (i.e. what you searched for or is described by the [[wikilink]] you clicked on).
  - You can see the list of all [[Nodes]] in this Agora.
  - You can also visit special location [[Random]] which will send you to some node out of the many gathered so far.
  - Or read [[Index]], inlined below; it is the community-maintained index of this Agora, which is richer and more diverse than this one.
- A <strong>User</strong> is anyone who has contributed resources to the Commons, either as part of a repository or individually through social media.
  - You can see the list of all [[Users]] and the nodes they've contributed to.

# Joining

The Agora is a bit different from most other sites around the internet in that joining is a **two step process** that begins elsewhere: 

- First you take notes/write/make posts in the editor(s) or platform(s) of your choice. 
- Then you tell an Agora that you'd like to contribute these resources to the Commons.

## Contributing your personal notes and other writing

You can contribute to this Agora by taking notes using a personal knowledge management system (like [[Obsidian]], [[Logseq]], [[SilverBullet]] or [[Bull]]); storing your notes in a [[Git]] repository (self hosted or with the help of a forge like [[Github]], [[Gitlab]] or [[Codeberg]]); and sending an email to <signup@anagora.org> with the location of your repository and your desired username. Please also review the code of conduct in node [[CONTRACT]], which you are expected to follow.

Notes can be [[Markdown]], [[Mycomarkup]] or [[Org mode]]. After integration, your notes will be available at the Agora locations matching their filenames as per the node convention described above. This means that if user A links to [[foo]] in a note and user B contributes `foo.md`, following the link in A's writing will surface also user B's resource.

If you don't use any of the above systems but would still like to contribute your writing, please reach out and we'll try to accommodate your preferred formats and sources!

## Posting from social media

You can also contribute to this Agora straight from social media! To do so, you need to follow an [[Agora Bot]] in a supported platform and then post following a convention.

- If you are in Mastodon/the Fediverse, you can follow <https://social.agor.ai/@agora>.
- If you are in [[Bluesky]], you can follow anagora.bsky.social.

Then write posts containing at least one [[wikilink]]; they will be linked in the mentioned nodes. You can additionally opt into storing copies of your messages and #hashtag handling by going through the [[opt in]] process once.
