# The four values of Agile

Go back to [[The Porter Plan]]

## The four values

As mentioned in [[The Agile Manifesto]] the 4 values of Agile are:

---
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboraion over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over Following a plan
---

## The Values explained

1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	1. For BAs this means more face to face vs documentation and following process
2. Working software over documentation
	1. Feedback on software over feedback on documentation
3. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	1. Shared understanding makes a better understanding than contracts
4. Responding to change over following a plan
	1. We plan in increments instead of Gannt charts
	2. Small pieces of value instead of large chunks
	3. Still plan long term in Agile
		1. Vision
		2. Roadmap
		3. Release plan
		4. These plans are about the value dimensions of what is being delivered
		5. Agile process tracking calls for *transparency*.
		6. Often exposes rough spots for the team that might have easily been hidden before
		7. WIP must be kept small to respond to change
