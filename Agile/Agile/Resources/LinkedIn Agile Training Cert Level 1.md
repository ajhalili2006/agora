# Agile Requirements Foundations

This entry is part of [[The Porter Plan]] and comes from [LinkedIn Learning](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/agile-requirements-foundations/the-agile-manifesto-from-a-business-analyst-perspective?u=2101657).

While it does offer a certification and ongoing learning credits for some professional accreditiations, it is not the official [[The Scrum Guide|Scrum]] certification. 

## Notes

### Business Analysts

For more go to [[Agile - Business Analyst Role]]

BAs work tangentially to the traditional scrum team to ensure the Product Owner:
- Has the right information
- Has the work broken down into actionable chunks for the development team
- Understands the needs of the user
- Comes back with products that represent actual value for the user

### Agile Values

For more, go to the [[The four values of Agile]]

As mentioned in [[The Agile Manifesto]], the 4 values of Agile are:

---
1. Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
2. Working software over comprehensive documentation
3. Customer collaboraion over contract negotiation
4. Responding to change over Following a plan

### The Agile Principles

For more, go to [[The twelve principles of Agile]]

As mentioned in [[The Agile Manifesto]], the twelve principles of Agile are:

---
1. Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
2. Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer’s competitive advantage.
3. Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
4. Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
5. Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
6. The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
7. Working software is the primary measure of progress.
8. Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
9. Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
10. Simplicity–the art of maximizing the amount of work not done–is essential.
11. The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
12. At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.
