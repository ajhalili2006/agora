# The Scrum Guide

Surprisingly brief at only 19 pages long, the Scrum Guide is the bases for all Scrum and Agile certifications.

I've printed out a copy and placed it in my left-hand desk draw for easy access. 

Otherwise, it's [free for download at](https://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v2017/2017-Scrum-Guide-US.pdf#zoom=100)

Given the document's brevity, memorisng and researching it seems like a pivotal step in [[The Porter Plan]].
