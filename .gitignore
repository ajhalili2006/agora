# Agora just pulls garden content from independent repos, perhaps this shouldn't be reproduced in the Agora repro proper.
# You could comment this out to get an all-inclusive Agora (a root repository that contains a snapshot of all its sources). 
# You might get trouble with nested git repositories. Look into submodules if you want to do that.
