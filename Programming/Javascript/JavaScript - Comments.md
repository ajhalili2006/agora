# Comments in JavaScript

Single line comments are handled with `//` while mult-line comments are handled with matching `/*` and `*/` pairs on separate lines:

```
/*
This is a mult-line comment.
****************************************************************
Everything in here is a comment.
*/

var FirstName = "John";
console.log(FirstName)

//This is a single line comment, nothing in this line will be executed

var LastName = "Smith";
var Age = 28;
console.log(LastName)
console.log(Age)

var FullAge = true;
console.log(FullAge);

var job;
console.log(job);

job = "Teacher";
console.log(job)


```
