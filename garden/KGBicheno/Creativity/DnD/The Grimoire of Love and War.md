 Millie Hide's Tome was found early in his career and never left his side. Thanks to his persistent, sometimes violent devotion to protecting the power of love and togetherness, the tome has been blessed forever by Hanali Celanil. Her loving whispers murmur forth from its pages whenever he opens it, whether to conduct a marriage ceremony, or to conduct battle.

#### Witch Bolt
*1st level Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** 30 feet
- **Components:** V, S, M (Something that has been struck by lightning)
- **Duration:** Concentration, up to 1 minute

A beam of crackling, blue energy lances out toward a creature within range, forming a sustained arc of lightning between you and the target. Make a ranged spell attack against that creature. On a hit, the target takes 1d12 lightning damage, and on each of your turns for the duration, you can use your action to deal 1d12 lightning damage to the target automatically. The spell ends if you use your action to do anything else. The spell also ends if the target is ever outside the spell's range or if it has total cover from you.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the initial damage increases by 1d12 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Disguise Self
*1st level Illusion*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 hour

You make yourself—including your clothing, armor, weapons, and other belongings on your person—look different until the spell ends or until you use your action to dismiss it. You can seem 1 foot shorter or taller and can appear thin, fat, or in between. You can't change your body type, so you must adopt a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you.
The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to your outfit, objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel your head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.
To discern that you are disguised, a creature can use its action to inspect your appearance and must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC.

#### Burning Hands
*1st level Evocation*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self (15 foot cone)
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** Instantaneous

As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a 15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
The fire ignites any flammable objects in the area that aren't being worn or carried.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.

#### Shield
*1st level Abjuration*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 reaction, which you take when you are hit by an attack or targeted by the magic missile spell
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S
- **Duration:** 1 round

An invisible barrier of magical force appears and protects you. Until the start of your next turn, you have a +5 bonus to AC, including against the triggering attack, and you take no damage from magic missile.

#### False Life
*1st level Necromancy*
___
- **Casting Time:** 1 action
- **Range:** Self
- **Components:** V, S, M (a small amount of alcohol or distilled spirits)
- **Duration:** 1 hour

Bolstering yourself with a necromantic facsimile of life, you gain 1d4 + 4 temporary hit points for the duration.

**At Higher Levels:** When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher, you gain 5 additional temporary hit points for each slot level above 1st.
