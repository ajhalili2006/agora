# An Emperor's Lamenting Thanks

This was written as a sign-off after Germany pledged support to my Austrian armies during a game of [[Diplomacy Games|Diplomacy]].

>My thanks soar among the clouds,
> delicate to the eye,
> soft rain to cool,
> dreams are born there,
> and all the time
> to fool 

Anyone worthy of calling themselves a person of state years for the day where they may no longer be one.
