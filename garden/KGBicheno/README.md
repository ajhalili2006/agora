# KGB_Agora
Kieran's Agora is a place of constant learning. While you may draw assumptions from what is being learned here, a friendly, open, and charitable discussion will be given a chance upon disagreement. 

Like all Agora, it may change. This is to be celebrated. Knowledge is not static.

## Who am I?

I'm a storyteller and lookout. I've been called 'Paḻaiya kai', 'hem-netjer', 'arlequin',
