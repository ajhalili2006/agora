## Coefficients

The coefficient value tells you the impact of a one-unit change in X on Y.

**Standard Errors/significance tell you whether one variable is a "driver" of changes in another variable**

Standard error tells you how confident we can be in our estimates.

R-Squared is critical in telling us how accurate our overall preduction model is â€” **An R-Squared value of 1.00 means you can always predict the left-side variable with 100% accuracy using the right-hand-side variables (y = ax+b)**

You can get a better regression by lagging the data for the *future* data.

# I.I.D = Independently and Identically Distributed

Each distribution has the same probability distribution as the others but are all independent of each other.
