# China PMI - The Best Indicator In The World

Go back to [[Economics main page]]

Chinese data is often viewed with scepticism

Primary indicator -->
Chinese Caixin Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (#PMI).

Much like the ones mentioned in [[German Ifo And Eurozone PMI]] and [[The importance Of Economic Reports]].

China is a manufacturing-based economy. 

Two manufacturing PMIs, 
- Government #PMI -> survey of large chinese manufacturers
- Caixin #PMI -> privately compiled survey of small and medium manufacturers

Both have a break-even of 50

**Caixin is a fantastic leading indicator for the global economy.**
