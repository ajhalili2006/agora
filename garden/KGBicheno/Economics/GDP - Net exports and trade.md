# GDP Net Exports And Trade

Go back to [[Economics main page]]

GDP is only calculted from what's built in the country, so 

-> Net #Exports = Exports - #Imports 

Negative Net Exports means Imports higher

Positive Net Exports means exports higher

**Terms of trade** #terms-of-trade

Currency -> net exports -> GDP

Low Currency -> import price up -> imports down
Low Currency -> export price down -> exports up

Therefore: Net GDP Gain -> strengthens GDP


High Currency -> import price down -> imports up
High Currency -> export price up -> exports down

Therefore: Net GDP Loss -> weakens GDP
