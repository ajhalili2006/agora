Where a tax really bites. Who ultimately pays a tax is often different from who the taxman collects the tax from, because the cost of the tax can be passed on. For example, by demanding higher WAGES if INCOME TAX rises, workers can transfer some of the TAX BURDEN to their employer's customers or shareholders.
