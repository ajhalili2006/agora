# Vertical integration

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Merging with a company at a different stage in the production process, for instance, a car maker merging with a car retailer or a parts supplier. Unlike HORIZONTAL INTEGRATION, it is likely to raise ANTITRUST concerns only if one of the companies already enjoys some MONOPOLY power, which the deal might allow it to extend into a new market.
