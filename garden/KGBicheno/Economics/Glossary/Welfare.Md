# Welfare

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Americans use welfare as shorthand for GOVERNMENT handouts to the poor. Economists use it to describe the well being of an individual or society, as in 'Are tax cuts welfare-enhancing?'. This is economist-speak for 'Will tax cuts improve the overall well being of the country?' (See UTILITY.)
