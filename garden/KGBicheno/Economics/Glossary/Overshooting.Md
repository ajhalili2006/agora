# Overshooting

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


The common tendency of PRICES in FINANCIAL MARKETS initially to move further than would seem strictly necessary in response to changes in the fundamentals that should, in theory, determine value. One reason may be that in the absence of perfect INFORMATION, investors move in herds, rushing in and out of markets on rumour. Eventually, as investors become better informed, the price usually returns to a more appropriate level. Overshooting is especially common during significant realignments of EXCHANGE RATES, but there are plenty of other examples. For instance, following the abolition of CAPITAL CONTROLS by some DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, the prices of EQUITIES in those countries initially soared to what proved to be unjustified levels as foreign CAPITAL rushed in, before settling in the longer-term at more sustainable valuations.
