# Spot price

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


The PRICE quoted for a transaction that is to be made on the spot, that is, paid for now for delivery now. Contrast spot markets with FORWARD CONTRACTS and futures markets, where payment and/or delivery will be made at some future date. Also contrast with long-term contracts, in which a price is agreed for repeated transactions over an extended time period and which may not involve immediate payment in full.
