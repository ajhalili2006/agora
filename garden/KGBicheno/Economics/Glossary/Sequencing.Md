# Sequencing

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Shorthand for implementing economic reforms in the right order. In recent years, this has become a hot topic in development economics. Some economists argue that introducing the right policies alone is not enough to revive a malfunctioning economy; reforms must be implemented in the right sequence. Thus they debate when in the reform process there should be, say, privatisation of state enterprises, and in which order, or the lifting of capital controls or other trade barriers. Other economists dispute whether there is a right sequence.
