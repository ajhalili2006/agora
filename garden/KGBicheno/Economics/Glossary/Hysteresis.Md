# Hysteresis

Lagging; slow to respond. Traditionally, econo­mists believed that high UNEMPLOYMENT was a ­cyclical phenomenon. Eventually, unemployment would cause people to lower their wage de­mands, and so new job opportunities would arise and unemployment would fall. More recently, however, economists have suggested that some unemployed people, especially the long-term jobless, can display hysteresis. They find it hard, perhaps impossible, to return to work, even when jobs become available. For instance, unemployed workers may gradually lose the motivation, self-confidence or the self-discipline, needed to get to the workplace and fulfil job requirements. Or their skills may become outdated and redundant. State benefits for the jobless may contribute to this hysteresis by making it easier from them to stay out of work.
