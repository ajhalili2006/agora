# Microeconomics

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


The study of the individual pieces that together make an economy. Contrast with MACROECONOMICS, the study of economy-wide phenomena such as GROWTH, INFLATION and UNEMPLOYMENT. Microeconomics considers issues such as how households reach decisions about CONSUMPTION and SAVING, how FIRMS set a PRICE for their OUTPUT, whether PRIVATISATION improves EFFICIENCY, whether a particular market has enough COMPETITION in it and how the market for LABOUR works.
