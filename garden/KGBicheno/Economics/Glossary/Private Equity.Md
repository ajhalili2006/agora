# Private equity

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


When a firmâ€™s SHARES are held privately and not traded in the public markets. Private equity includes shares in both mature private companies and, as VENTURE CAPITAL, in newly started businesses. As it is less liquid than publicly traded EQUITY, investors in private equity expect on average to earn a higher EQUITY RISK PREMIUM from it.
