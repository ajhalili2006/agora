Open-market operations

CENTRAL BANKS buying and selling SECURITIES in the open market, as a way of controlling INTEREST rates or the GROWTH of the MONEY SUPPLY. By selling more securities, they can mop up surplus MONEY; buying securities adds to the money supply. The securities traded by central banks are mostly GOVERNMENT BONDS and TREASURY BILLS, although they sometimes buy or sell commercial securities.
