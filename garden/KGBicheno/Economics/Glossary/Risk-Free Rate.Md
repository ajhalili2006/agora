# Risk-free rate

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


The RATE OF RETURN earned on a risk-free ASSET. This is a crucial component of MODERN PORTFOLIO theory, which assumes the existence of both risky and risk-free assets. The risk-free asset is usually assumed to be a GOVERNMENT BOND, and the risk-free rate is the YIELD on that bond, although in fact even a Treasury is not entirely without risk. In modern portfolio theory, the risk-free rate is lower than the EXPECTED RETURN on the risky asset, because the issuer of the risky asset has to offer RISK AVERSE investors the expectation of a higher return to persuade them to forgo the risk-free asset.
