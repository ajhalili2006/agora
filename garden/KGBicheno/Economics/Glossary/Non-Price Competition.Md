# Non-price competition

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Trying to win business from rivals other than by charging a lower PRICE. Methods include ADVERTISING, slightly differentiating your product, improving its quality, or offering free gifts or discounts on subsequent purchases. Non-price competition is particularly common when there is an OLIGOPOLY, perhaps because it can give an impression of fierce rivalry while the FIRMS are actually colluding to keep prices high.
Normal goods

When average INCOME increases, the DEMAND for normal goods increases, too. The opposite of INFERIOR GOODS.
