# Price

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


In EQUILIBRIUM, what balances SUPPLY and DEMAND. The price charged for something depends on the tastes, INCOME and ELASTICITY of demand of customers. It depends on the amount of COMPETITION in the market. Under PERFECT COMPETITION, all FIRMS are price takers. Where there is a MONOPOLY, or firms have some MARKET POWER, the seller has some control over the price, which will probably be higher than in a perfectly competitive market. By how much more will depend on how much market power there is, and on whether the firm(s) with the market power are committed to PROFIT MAXIMISATION. In some cases, firms may charge less than the profit-maximising price for strategic or other reasons (see PREDATORY PRICING).
