# Zero-sum game

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


When the gains made by winners in an economic transaction equal the losses suffered by the losers. It is identified as a special case in GAME THEORY. Most economic transactions are in some sense positive-sum games. But in popular discussion of economic issues, there are often examples of a mistaken zero-sum mentality, such as “PROFIT comes at the expense of WAGES”, “higher PRODUCTIVITY means fewer jobs”, and “IMPORTS mean fewer jobs here”.
