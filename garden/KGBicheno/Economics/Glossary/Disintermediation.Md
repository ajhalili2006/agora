# Disintermediation

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Cutting out the middleman. Disintermediation has become a buzz word in financial services in particular, as competitive and technological changes have done away with the need for established intermediaries. BANKS have seen much of their business slip away, such as lending to companies that now tap CAPITAL MARKETS direct. NEW ECONOMY Â­theorists argued that many retailers would be disintermediated as the internet enabled customers to transact directly with producers without needing to visit a shop. But this has happened more slowly than they predicted.
Diversification

Not putting all your eggs in one basket. Investors are encouraged to do this by MODERN PORTFOLIO THEORY, as holding several different SHARES and other ASSETS helps to reduce RISK. At the sharp end of business, however, diversification is somewhat out of fashion. Economic studies of diversifying corporate MERGERS have found that these often hurt the shareholders of the acquiring firm; by contrast, diversified FIRMS that have sold off non-core businesses have typically made their shareholders much better off.
