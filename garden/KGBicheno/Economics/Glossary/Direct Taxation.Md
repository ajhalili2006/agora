# Direct taxation

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Taxes levied on the INCOME or wealth of an individual or company. Contrast with INDIRECT TAXATION. In much of the world, direct tax rates fell during the 1980s and 1990s, partly because some economists argued that high rates of tax on income discouraged people from working, and that high rates of tax on PROFIT encouraged companies to move to countries with lower rates. Furthermore, high rates of INCOME TAX were viewed as politically unpopular. Even so, although rates were cut, because both personal income and corporate profits grew steadily throughout this period the total amount collected via direct taxation continued to rise. Economists often disagree about which of direct taxes or indirect taxes are the least inefficient method of taxation.
