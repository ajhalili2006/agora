# Scalability

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


The ease with which the SUPPLY of an economic product or process can be expanded to meet increased DEMAND. Recent technological advances have led some economists to talk about the growing importance of instant scalability. For example, once a piece of software has been written it can be made available in an instant over the Internet to unlimited numbers of users for almost no cost. This potentially allows a new product to enter and win market share far more quickly than ever before, intensifying COMPETITION and perhaps accelerating the process of creative destruction (see SCHUMPETER).
