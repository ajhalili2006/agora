# Mixed economy

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


A market economy in which both private-sector FIRMS and firms owned by GOVERNMENT take part in economic activity. The proportions of public and private enterprise in the mix vary a great deal among countries. Since the 1980s, the public role in most mixed economies declined as NATIONALISATION gave way to PRIVATISATION.
