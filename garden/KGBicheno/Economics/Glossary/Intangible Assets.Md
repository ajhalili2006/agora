# Intangible assets

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Valuable things, even though you cannot drop them on your foot - an idea, say, especially one protected by a PATENT; an effective corporate culture; HUMAN CAPITAL; a popular brand. Contrast with TANGIBLE ASSETS.
Intellectual capital

The part of a country's or a firm's CAPITAL or an individual's HUMAN CAPITAL that consists of ideas rather than something more physical. It can often be protected through PATENTS or other intellectual property laws.
Interest

The cost of borrowing, which compensates lenders for the RISK they take in making their money available to borrowers. Without interest there would be little lending and thus a lot less economic activity. The charging of interest is contrary to Sharia (Islamic) law, being considered USURY. Some American states also have usury laws, imposing tough conditions on the terms set by lenders, although not actually prohibiting interest. Yet, as the recent rise of a substantial banking industry in Islamic Middle Eastern countries shows, when economic GROWTH is a priority, ways can usually be found to pay lenders to lend.
