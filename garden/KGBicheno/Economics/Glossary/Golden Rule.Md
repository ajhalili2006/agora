# Golden rule

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Over the economic cycle, a government should borrow only to invest and not to finance current spending. This rule is certainly a prudent approach to fiscal policy, provided that governments are honest in describing spending as investment, that they invest in appropriate things and do so efficiently, and that they are careful to avoid crowding out superior private investment. But there are other fiscal policy options that may make as much sense. See, for example, balanced budget.
