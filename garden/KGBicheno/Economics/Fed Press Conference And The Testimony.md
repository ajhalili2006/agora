Go back to [[Economics main page]]

Fed Chair's words will move markets - easily

- Press conferences after Fed decisions
- Testimony before Congress

Press conferences are disected by Fed Watchers who listen out for 'Fed Speak'

These folks hope to catch the chair saying too much, which has happened.

During testimony Congress will be looking for a snippet they can use to back their policy goals and objectives.

The Fed Chair has to say as little as possible that hasn't been measured as much as possible.
