# Sharing a Jupyter Notebook on Github


![What it looks like on your Gist dash](https://i.imgur.com/PF4ZZHX.png)

A proper guide for this exists here at [cognitiveclass.ai](https://cognitiveclass.ai/blog/data-scientists-stand-out-by-sharing-your-notebooks), but the basics are simple:

- right click on the notebook you wish to share on the left-hand file panel and choose "Share on GitHub"
- Sign in and Authorise
- You'll be given the link to a Gist where your notebook has been shared.

My [first shared Jupyter Notebook](https://gist.github.com/KGBicheno/78fa9b16289092497eff1827305d93cd) can be found here on my GitHub Gist page.
