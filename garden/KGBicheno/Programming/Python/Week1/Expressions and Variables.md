## Expressions

Operations that Python and the computers perform.

`50 + 60 * 2 = 170` 

- Operands: The numbers in the operation
- Operators: The signs in the operation

**A note on division**

Division: `25 / 6 = 4.166 ...` <- the result is a float and approximate.
Integer Division: `25 // 6 = 4` <- the result is an int and has lost precision.

Python3 follows order convention.

## Variables

We use variables to store values in multiples places. We assign variables a value using the `=` operator. 

We can perform operations on variables and assign the value to variables, and pass them into functions like `type()` just like before.
