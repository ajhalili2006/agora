# Making an importable Python module
**This note is a stub and must be updated.**

- Make a Python **Package**
	- Create a folder with an __init__.py file
	- Python files inside that folder can be imported as **Python modules**

## Further research
1. Check if it's the file or the functions within that file that are callable as modules.
