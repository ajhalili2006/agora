The absolute basic function AI would provide in the newsroom would be to sift through existing and incoming content and use NLP to ensure consitent and effective metadata is created.

This should then allow for meta-content such as appropriate stock images or backlinks to be applied to content. Topic pages, feature pages, and galleries could be created without human intervention and according to trend data.

AI can create:
- captions
- teases
- headlines
- tags
- backlinks
- pullquotes
- inline links
- galleries
- alerts
- newsletters
- suggestions for each of these
