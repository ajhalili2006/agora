# 6 Conversation and Design

If conversation is going to be the primary form of interaction with your bot, language choice needs to be carefully crafted.
- Descriminatory language must be avoided at all cost
- People must be given every chance to express how they wish to be addressed
- Trollish language directed at the bot must be dealt with in a constructive and direct manner

A Feminist approach to conversation includes:
- empathy
- inclusivity
- accessible language
- accessible images
- inclusive modes of address

The course material ends here, but these notes will continue.
