# F'xa And Chatbot Railroading

[F'xa the chatbot](http://www.f-xa.co/) seemed like an interesting way of delivering content, but at the same time I felt completely railroaded, as though I wasn't chatting, but clicking to get through a cut-scene.

How would I get around this? I don't like site-based chatbots for this exact reason. 

- I could use multiple personas in the one chatstream
- I could make sure the chatbot wasn't the only form of interaction
- I would make sure to have branches go wider earlier

#Fxa was built by #Feminist_Internet and is a worthy addition to the information transition toolkit, but I'll always prefer the open chatroom as an environment for bots.
