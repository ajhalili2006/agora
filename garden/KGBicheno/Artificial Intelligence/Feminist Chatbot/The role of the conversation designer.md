# The role of the conversation designer

The conversation designer takes on the role of an architect in a bot creation project.

They take on the following tasks:

- Map out what users can do in a space
- Consider the [[Stakeholders vs Users|stakeholders]]' needs
- Work out the technological constraints
- Define the conversation flow's underlying logic
- Represent that flow in a design specification
- Represent the complete user experience
- Partner with stakeholders and developers through interations
