# Storyboarding - Trigger

What is it that causes the stakeholder to interact with the chatbot?

Do I want to motivate the stakeholder to use the chatbot? 

If so, how do I keep the chatbot in the front of the stakeholder's mind when the trigger appears? 

What mechanism exists for that? What does it look like?

Storyboard that. Make that apparent in the storyboard.
