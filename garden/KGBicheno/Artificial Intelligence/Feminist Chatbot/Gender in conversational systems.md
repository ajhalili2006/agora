# Avoiding gender in human-bot communication

Being too conversational can be problematic and result in misgendering.

Human-presenting bots are trying to gain the stakeholder's trust - why? You have to ask yourself why you're looking for that trust and what you're doing with it. 

If your system is using gendered language allow it to be an input.

Ask yourself why you're using gendered language.
