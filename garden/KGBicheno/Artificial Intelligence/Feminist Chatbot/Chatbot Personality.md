## Step 1

Brainstorm how you want people to perceive your chatbot.

## Step 2

Narrow that list down to 4-6 key attributes

## Step 3

Pick a few characters that embody your chatbot.

You're going for the Minds from the Culture â€” you're fine.

## Step 4

Choose the closest character and write a brief description.

Show what they're like and what they would say and do.

## Step 5
