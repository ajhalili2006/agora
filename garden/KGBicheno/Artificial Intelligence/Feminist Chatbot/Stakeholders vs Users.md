- Stakeholder is less conceptually limiting
- Stakeholder includes people who have an interest but might be otherwise missed
- User can come across as demeaning or subjectifying
- You need to consider externalities, and broadening your thought process helps with that
- Users have a stake in what you're doing
- Elevating others is inherently good for your brand and for society
