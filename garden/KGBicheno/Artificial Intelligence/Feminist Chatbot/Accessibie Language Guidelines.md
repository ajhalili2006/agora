# Accessible Language Guidelines

The guidelines are provided by [Digital.gov.nz](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/design-and-ux/accessibility/accessible-language/)

Accessible language is language that includes everyone.

People can feel excluded when:

    they don’t understand words or phrases
    language is used in ways that pose challenges to users of other technologies, such as text-to-speech software.

People are more likely to use your website if:

    it’s easy to navigate
    the information is clear and easy to understand.

See [here](https://www.digital.govt.nz/standards-and-guidance/design-and-ux/accessibility/accessible-language/) for the full list.
