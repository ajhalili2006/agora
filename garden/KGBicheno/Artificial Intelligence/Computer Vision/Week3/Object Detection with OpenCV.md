# Object Detection with OpenCV

Go back to the [[Computer Vision Week 3 Main File]]

This topic is [explained in the video 'Object Detection with OpenCV'](https://coursera.org/share/6a4bf6548c2e45293f70e343abdbca4a)

The code itself and the results are contained in [this lab on how to use OpenCV](https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-CV0101EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/Module5/Object_Detection_with_OpenCV_Python.ipynb)

This is followed by an interactive lab on [image processing with Python and OpenCV](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-computer-vision-watson-opencv/ungradedLti/u1352/lab-image-processing-and-analysis-in-opencv-with-python)
