1. Tagging scenes of video with text annotations
	1. Speeding up searching through security footage for suspects
2. Identifying parts of a structure from a grid of sub-images taken from a group of high-resolution images of the structure.
	1. Those sub-images identified as being part of the structure can then be further classified as showing or not showing damage such as rust or hail damage.
	2. This would dramatically shorten the amount of time taken to identify damage and defects, saving engineering, construction, and insurance companies billions.
3. Using drones to investigate large-scale infrastructure instead of humans.
