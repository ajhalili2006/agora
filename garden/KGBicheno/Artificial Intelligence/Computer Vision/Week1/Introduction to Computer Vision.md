# Introduction to Computer Vision

See the [[Computer Vision Week 1 Main File]] or the [[Main AI Page]]

This course will cover the following:

 - What is Computer Vision?
 - Apply Computer Vision algorithms with Python and OpenCV
 - Create my own classifiers to apply to business problems
 - Build my own web app to classify images

What I will not learn, includes
 - how computer vision works,
 - how neural networks or deep learning work, 
 - maths and statistics. 

## What is Computer Vision?

**Computer Vision:** Providing computers the ability to see and understand what an image is.

Why? 

At a high level, the reason why computer vision or any technology is adopted, is because of some improvement. It could be that something: 
 - slower becomes
 - significantly faster, expensive becomes cheaper,
 - manual becomes automated, difficult becomes easy,
 - inconvenient becomes convenient,
 - unscalable becomes scalable. 

See Abu Dhabi National Oil Company case study for an example.

## On the questionable side ...

In the HR world, computer vision is changing how candidates get hired in the interview process. Knockri, a Canadian based startup, is making waves with their AI video soft skill assessment tool.

By using computer vision, machine learning and data science, they're able to quantify soft skills and conduct early candidate assessments to help large companies shortlist the candidates.
