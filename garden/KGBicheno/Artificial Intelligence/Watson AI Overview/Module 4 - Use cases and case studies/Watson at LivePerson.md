Like nobody really wants to make a phone call.Typically, email is a little too much.So you want to do it in the ways thatyou want to which is messaging,text messaging, Facebook Messenger,through the brand's app.Right now, it's a mess.A brand has 8 to 10 touch pointswith a consumer across different social networks,email relationship, call enter.

For the first time,messaging is a platform that can reach every consumer.The biggest problem, the primary one isthis terrible legacy voice system.So it's absurd that you have tospend 20 minutes or 30 minutes onhold with a large companythat you're paying or do business with them.So it's both terrible for consumers,they can't stand 800 numbers voice calls,the IVR, hold music,all these things that make peoplehave see red, they're angry.

Everybody here has made acustomer service phone call and youwalk away and you're like this is horrible.But think about that life as an agent.They're getting that constantly fromthe other side of all day long, almost no breaks.So there's heavy attrition in that industry,it's upwards of 40 percent in some cases which is a very,very large attrition number.Working with the Watson team has been amazing, fantastic.

With Watson's a leading, the leading AI out there.There's almost nobody that'seven close at this point in time.So when we take our leading platform anda leading AI such as Watson and we pulled them together,it elevates the platform to a much bigger level.In our system, Watson is like an agent itself.Watson sits alongside human agents.

If Watson can't answer something,the system passes it seamlessly to a human agent.We're cutting costs forbrands, we're increasing conversations.More conversations are coming through.We're giving agents a better job.We're allowing them to up level their jobs,we're allowing them to thinkabout things in the right way,and really use their intelligenceacross the board in a better way.

I've seen certain situations,very specific situations incertain departments where we'regetting to 80 percent ofconversations being resolved by the AI.That's a pretty fantastic number.

Agents are judged on thingslike CSAT, customer satisfaction.You can do the same thing with Watson,virtual agents, digital agents.They can and they should be measured just like humans.I think that brands are goingto be putting messaging front and center.

We're going to move into a future that there's going tobe less apps and less complex website,these all going to be inside a conversation.

The brands that make it the most seamless forto reach them on messaging are going to win.You can bring the best ofthe AI world and the human world into a single system,totally seamlessly and make customers happy.

To the first time in history,you've had 100 percent access to people,100 percent of the time.That as a premise changesthe way that brands andconsumers will interact with each other.
