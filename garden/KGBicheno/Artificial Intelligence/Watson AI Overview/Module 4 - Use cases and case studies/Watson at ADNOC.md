Digital technology is nowstarting to come into the oil business.The common practice was that weutilize our expert geologists who arelimited in number todescribe all the classification of rocks, and ultimately identify the right locationsfor our wells to be drilled.

They love to capture knowledge,transfer that knowledge to a younger generation.Artificial intelligence is the way togo to help us meeting these targets.

The time has come forthe digital transformation to come into the oil business.When we started out, there was a very important question,"Can artificial intelligence really beapplied to such a technical domain such as geology?

"ADNOC and IBM are now having this joint project to applytechnology which is used to recognizeflowers to be applied into rock classification.We use the high resolution photosto populate the database in the IBM software.

IBM Watson team were translating this intothe image recognition model of Watson toaccurately describe the same level of our geologists.When we started testing, I started to see the outcome.It was eye-opening for both sides.

With this technology, we can gointo thousands of analysis per day.So it's not only rock data,but it will go also to seismic data,and more and more areas to come.We've already announced our planfor five million barrels per day.

The only way we can achievethis ambitious project is through technology.

We have gained and retainedour expert knowledge into machine and thenwe can utilize it in anytime withour young generations on solving a new challenges.

Digital transformation is about understandingour industry and understanding our business better.Also, it helps us to retain knowledge.
