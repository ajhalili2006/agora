Hi, Connie.How may I help you? I amHilton's newest concierge in training.Thanks to a pilot project between Hilton and IBM.Hospitality is a really interesting use casefor Watson because inevitably,you have people who need information.They need to find a restaurant,they need to find a park,they need to get directions.We operate in a very crowded industry.So innovation is key.

Innovation has to help solve problems operationally.Innovation has to help our customers.It's an opportunity to do really delightcustomers in ways that they don't expect.We're really excited about being able to build outthe cognitive learning capabilities with IBM and Watson.

At the same time,as we have Connie interacting with our guests.It's much more natural.

It's something that people canidentify with as much more comfortableand something that allows them tohave a more insightful interaction actually.

It allows us to really serve people,understand what they're looking for,sense their emotions, sense their level of urgency.

To be able to take robotics and artificial intelligence and introduce it tothe hotel business as a wayof helping us operate more efficiently,helping us to delight our customers, it's a big dream.

What excites me about this partnership isthe courage of Hilton to try something new,the courage of wave laser to build on the technology.

So that courage is going to pushus to continue to advance Connie,and that's also going to allow the humans who work in those hotels to gobeyond that to help people even furtherby having Connie do the basic things.Goodbye. I hope to be ablehelp you with Hilton Hotels again soon.
