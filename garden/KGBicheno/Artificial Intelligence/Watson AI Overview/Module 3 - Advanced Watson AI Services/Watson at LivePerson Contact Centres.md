Snippets from the module:
	
## Touch points with customers	

	Nobody really wants to make a phone call. Typically, email is a little too much. So you want to do it in the ways that you want to which is messaging, text messaging, Facebook Messenger, through the brand's app. Right now, it's a mess. A brand has 8 to 10 touch points with a consumer across different social networks, email relationship, call enter. 
	
## Attrition rates in call centres

	So there's heavy attrition in that industry, it's upwards of 40 percent in some cases which is a very, very large attrition number. If Watson can't answer something, the system passes it seamlessly to a human agent. We're cutting costs for brands, we're increasing conversations. More conversations are coming through. We're giving agents a better job. We're allowing them to up level their jobs, we're allowing them to think about things in the right way, and really use their intelligence across the board in a better way. 
	
## Impact on KPIs
	
	I've seen certain situations, very specific situations in certain departments where we're getting to 80 percent of conversations being resolved by the AI. Agents are judged on things like CSAT, customer satisfaction.You can do the same thing with Watson, virtual agents, digital agents. They can and they should be measured just like humans. I think that brands are going to be putting messaging front and center. We're going to move into a future that there's going to be less apps and less complex website, these all going to be inside a conversation.
