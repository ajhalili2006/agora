## Company: Thomson Reuters

Industry: Law

Thomson Reuters is responsible for a lot of the industry's top legal advice on data protection, data privacy, and data regulation.

Helped IMB generate the first **Question and Answer** service Watson offered.

An important note in these systems:

	The objective is not only to teach Watson how to answer the questions on which it was trained - "Does Australian law require regulator notification of a data breach?", for example - but also to ensure that Ask Watson a Question is able to extrapolate and answer questions that legal professionals will ask in the future.
