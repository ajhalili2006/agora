## How Watson learned, in five easy steps:

### 1. Watson was trained

Watson absorbed over 600,000 pages of documentation, from reports to correspondence.

### 2. Watson was tested

The machine learning model was continuously updated to be able to analyze a higher volume of records.

### 3. Watson was launched

Over 80% of employees adopted Watson for their day-to-day work.

### 4. Watson got results

Employees used to spend 80% of their time researching problems and 20% fixing it. Watson has reversed that.

### 5. Watson keeps learning

Employees are encouraged to provide feedback, whether theyâ€™re brand new or have years of experience.
