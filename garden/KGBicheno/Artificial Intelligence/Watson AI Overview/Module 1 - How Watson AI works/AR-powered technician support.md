## Company: Apple

Industry: Logistics

Both Apple (Core ML) and IBM (Watson) have their own AI offerings, which they combined for an online/offline app offering for developers called **Watson services for CoreML (WSCML)**.

Coca-Cola is going through IBM to access WSCML for damage identification and diagnosis in the field using cognitive technologies like visual recognition.

A major use of this tech is for technicians to image the problem and use the AI to quickly search an enormous knowledgebase for information that they might not be familiar with specifically. This saves what could be hours of search time and a frustrating situation.

#NewsRoomIdea Just the knowledgebase exploration capabilities attached to a sufficiently-large corpus of news articles would be an amazing resource for journalists.

#ToDo Start scraping - like, absolutely hoovering - ABC news articles.

From IBM:

	As the technician is working on the job, data is captured. That data is then sent to the cloud once the device is back on the network, so Watson can learn from the interaction and make the learning available to other technicians in near real-time. Using the guided repair system, the technician is empowered to solve the problem the first time, increasing productivity, and elevating customer service â€“ all without needing to call for assistance or reschedule the repair.
