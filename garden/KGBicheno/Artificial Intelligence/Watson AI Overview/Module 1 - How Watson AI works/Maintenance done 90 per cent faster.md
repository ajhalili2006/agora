## Korean Air 

Industry: Aviation

Years of maintenance records had become impenetrable in their size and density, meaning technicians were always relearning what had already been learned.

Watson Explorer to the rescue again.

200,000 cases were addressed 90% faster, 2000 employees were able to act faster.

25 million customers kept happier. 

Technology to the rescue in a huge way from a direction that wouldn't have been obvious before. 

## How Korean Air worked with Watson

- Watson ingested a variety of structured and unstructured data related to maintenance for the hundreds of planes in Korean Airâ€™s fleet.
- Maintenance defect issues are reported by flight or cabin crews to ground operations.
- Maintenance employees access data from look-a-like cases against technical guidelines.
- Watson assists to decide probable cause and recommends solutions so that they can be quickly addressed by technicians.
