### Vendor lock-in

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]

A situation where an organisation is unable to make optimal technological decisions because too many of their tech assets are bound up with one vendor. A lack of compatibility with a new or beneficial technology would not be possible because their current infrastructure is not mobile enough to make use of it.
