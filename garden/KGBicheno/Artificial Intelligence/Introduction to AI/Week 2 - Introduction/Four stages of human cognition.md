## The four stages

1. First, we observe visible phenomena and bodies of evidence. 
2. Second, we draw on what we know to interpret what we are seeing to generate hypotheses about what it means. 
3. Third, we evaluate which hypotheses are right or wrong. 
4. Finally, we decide, choosing the option that seems best and acting accordingly.
