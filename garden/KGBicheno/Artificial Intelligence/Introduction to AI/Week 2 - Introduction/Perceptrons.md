Part of the page on [[Neural Networks]]

The simplest form of [[Neural Networks]], with a single layer with input nodes connected directly to an output node.

input layers forward the input values to the next layer by means of multiplying by a weight and then summing the results.

Neural networks are vastly more complicated versions of this, with layers upon layers forwarding values through weights, one for each neuron in the next layer. This allows for incredible fine-tuning as the number of neurons increases.
