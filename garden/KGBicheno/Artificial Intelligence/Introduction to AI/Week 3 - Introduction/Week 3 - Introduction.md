# Week 3 - Ethics and glossary

**Note:** It's worth noting here that the majority, if not all, notes here come from the readings sent to me by Assoc Prof Angela Romano, not from the IBM course. They are recorded both here and under the readings heading in the MPhil section as they are, for the most part, relevant to both.
