People are generally unaware that AI has pervaded every part of the news media.

	The  paradoxis that according to the HubSpot’s survey, the majority of users (over 63%) do  not realize that they are already using AI technologies [19]. On one hand, this jeopardizes the possibility to identifythe ownerofthe content andevaluate its reliability accordingly, which is especially important today in the midst of the post-truth era and so-called “fake news” epidemic. On the other hand, it gives a chance to the media to build a more active dialogue with the audience without losing the featuresinherent in the trusted interpersonal communication.
