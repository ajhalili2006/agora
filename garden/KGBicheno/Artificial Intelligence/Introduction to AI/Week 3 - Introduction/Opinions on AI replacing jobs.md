# Opinions on AI replacing jobs

### Saad & Issa:

	There  is  no  doubt that AI is  going to affect the  way the  media  works  in  many fields, now, there are only 15%  of automation  in reporters'  work around the world and 9%  of the  editors'  work,of course many  jobs  and  tasks  will  disappear,  and  robots  will  do  these  tasks,but,  AIwill  surely  not  replace humans in the near future, on the contrary, humans  will remain the controllersand supervisorsof AI and would benefit of these technologies to do their work fast, accurate and more efficient.

### Patrick White:

	Patrick  White,  a  professor  of  journalism  at  Quebec  university  at  Montrealargues  that  one  of  the dangers of AI, on the other hand, is algorithm bias,because algorithms are designed by humans, there will always  be  biases  that  can  alter  data  analysis  and  lead  to  serious  consequences.  And  human verification of content before publication will always remain a safeguard against errors

### Francesco Marconi:

	In his book:"Newsmakers" Francesco Marconi, who has led the development of the Associated Press and Wall Street Journal’s use of AI in journalism, offers a new perspective on the potential of these technologies. He explains how reporters, editors, and newsrooms of all sizes can take advantage of the possibilities they provide to develop new ways of telling stories and connecting with readers., he tried to answer confusing  question,  willthe use  of artificial intelligence (AI), be the  end  of  journalism as weknow it, or its savior?(4)

### Waddel & Franklin

	Waddell  (2017) study reveals  that  news  assumed  to  be  written  by  a  machine  is  perceived  as  less credible  than  news  declared  to  be  written  by  a  human,  it  appears  that  news  writing  is  still  largely perceived as “a human'sjob.” Although machine-based automation  is  commonplace and accepted  in fields  such  as  automobile  production  or  clothes  manufacturing,  it  remains  relatively  novel  and unexpected  in  a  domain  such  as  news  production.

### Jonathan Stray

 	Jonathan  Stray  has  written  for  Columbia  journalism review, artificial intelligence won’t replace journalism so much as augment it(3),  says:  I  feel  huge sympathies  for many journalists  who face  increased competition from software, but also believe that software  is  simply  incapable,  for  the foreseeable  future,  of  achieving  many  of  the  tasks  required  of human writers, however, is not a threat to journalism, yet.
