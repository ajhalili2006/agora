#recsystems

The final stage of a recommendation system, during which scored items may be re-graded according to some other (typically, non-ML) algorithm. Re-ranking evaluates the list of items generated by the scoring phase, taking actions such as:

    Eliminating items that the user has already purchased.
    Boosting the score of fresher items.
