### PR AUC (area under the PR curve)

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Area under the interpolated precision-recall curve, obtained by plotting (recall, precision) points for different values of the classification threshold. Depending on how it's calculated, PR AUC may be equivalent to the average precision of the model.
