### decision tree

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


A model represented as a sequence of branching statements. For example, the following over-simplified decision tree branches a few times to predict the price of a house (in thousands of USD). According to this decision tree, a house larger than 160 square meters, having more than three bedrooms, and built less than 10 years ago would have a predicted price of 510 thousand USD.

A tree three-levels deep whose branches predict house prices.

Machine learning can generate deep decision trees.
