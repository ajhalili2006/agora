### loss curve

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


A graph of loss as a function of training iterations. For example:

A graph of loss versus training iterations, showing a steady drop as iterations increase, but then a slight rise in loss at a high number of iterations.

The loss curve can help you determine when your model is converging, overfitting, or underfitting.
