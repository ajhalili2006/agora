### structural risk minimization (SRM)

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


An algorithm that balances two goals:

    The desire to build the most predictive model (for example, lowest loss).
    The desire to keep the model as simple as possible (for example, strong regularization).

For example, a function that minimizes loss+regularization on the training set is a structural risk minimization algorithm.

For more information, see http://www.svms.org/srm/.

Contrast with empirical risk minimization.
