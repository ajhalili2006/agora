### regularization

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


The penalty on a model's complexity. Regularization helps prevent overfitting. Different kinds of regularization include:

    L1 regularization
    L2 regularization
    dropout regularization
    early stopping (this is not a formal regularization method, but can effectively limit overfitting)
