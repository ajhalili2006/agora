### generative model

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Practically speaking, a model that does either of the following:

- Creates (generates) new examples from the training dataset. For example, a generative model could create poetry after training on a dataset of poems. The generator part of a generative adversarial network falls into this category.
- Determines the probability that a new example comes from the training set, or was created from the same mechanism that created the training set. For example, after training on a dataset consisting of English sentences, a generative model could determine the probability that new input is a valid English sentence.

A generative model can theoretically discern the distribution of examples or particular features in a dataset. That is:

p(examples)

Unsupervised learning models are generative.

Contrast with discriminative models.
