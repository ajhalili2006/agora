### sparse feature

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Feature vector whose values are predominately zero or empty. For example, a vector containing a single 1 value and a million 0 values is sparse. As another example, words in a search query could also be a sparse featureâ€”there are many possible words in a given language, but only a few of them occur in a given query.

Contrast with dense feature.
