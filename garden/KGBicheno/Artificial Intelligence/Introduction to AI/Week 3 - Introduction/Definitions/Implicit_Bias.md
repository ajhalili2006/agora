#fairness

Automatically making an association or assumption based on oneâ€™s mental models and memories. Implicit bias can affect the following:

    How data is collected and classified.
    How machine learning systems are designed and developed.

For example, when building a classifier to identify wedding photos, an engineer may use the presence of a white dress in a photo as a feature. However, white dresses have been customary only during certain eras and in certain cultures.
