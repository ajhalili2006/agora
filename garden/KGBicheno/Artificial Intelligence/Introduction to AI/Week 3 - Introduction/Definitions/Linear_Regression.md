### linear regression

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Using the raw output `y^1` of a linear model as the actual prediction in a regression model. The goal of a regression problem is to make a real-valued prediction. For example, if the raw output `y^1` of a linear model is 8.37, then the prediction is 8.37.

Contrast linear regression with logistic regression. Also, contrast regression with classification.
