### outliers

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Values distant from most other values. In machine learning, any of the following are outliers:

    Weights with high absolute values.
    Predicted values relatively far away from the actual values.
    Input data whose values are more than roughly 3 standard deviations from the mean.

Outliers often cause problems in model training. Clipping is one way of managing outliers.
