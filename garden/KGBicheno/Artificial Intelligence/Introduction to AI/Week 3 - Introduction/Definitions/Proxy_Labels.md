### proxy labels

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Data used to approximate labels not directly available in a dataset.

For example, suppose you want is it raining? to be a Boolean label for your dataset, but the dataset doesn't contain rain data. If photographs are available, you might establish pictures of people carrying umbrellas as a proxy label for is it raining? However, proxy labels may distort results. For example, in some places, it may be more common to carry umbrellas to protect against sun than the rain.
