### natural language processing

Go back to the [[AI Glossary]]


Natural Language Processing is the domain within machine learning dealing with the tasks required for a machine to work with natural language at a level of abstraction close to that, or at, which humans use it. 

These tasks include:

- tokenisation
- tagging
- lemmatisation
- dependancy identification and parsing trees
- shape identification
- part-of-speech recognition
- named entity recognition (NER)
