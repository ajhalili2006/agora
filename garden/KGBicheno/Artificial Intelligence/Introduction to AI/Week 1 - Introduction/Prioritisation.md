	Whenever you think or hear “we can’t because...,” rephrase it and use “we can if....” Once you get on paper what would be required to achieve what is being asked, no matter how unattainable it seems, you can then budget and prioritize and make informed decisions on whether to move forward. Most things that seem impossible are quite doable once you’ve thought through all the options and requirements. Also: If there are 10 things that are stressing you out and you have control or influence over eight of them, focus on those eight and let the other two go.
