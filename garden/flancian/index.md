- This is a user contributed [[subnode]].
- For now each user can just contribute a file named ```index.md``` and it will show in the Agora's index page. Later on ranking/filtering algorithmms might need to be implemented. These will be ***open*** and ***community maintained***.
- I am a [[Flancian]], who are you?

- Perhaps [[index]] should be a special node that shows in the home page.
- For now each user can just contribute a subnode and it will show here for sure. Later on ranking might need to be implemented :)
- Please always try to uphold this [[Agora]]'s [[contract]].
