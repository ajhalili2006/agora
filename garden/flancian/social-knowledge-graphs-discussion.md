# Social Knowledge Graphs Discussion

- Set up by [[dan whaley]] and [[jennifer rygh]].
- Agenda: search for 'social knowledge graphs discussion' in Drive (not linking for now).
  - [[same as]] question -- I've been struggling with this myself for some time now.
    - Perhaps my answer is that we should favour simplicity in the data structure/interface and try to solve it using the social aspect of distributed knowledge graphs; ranking/disambiguation information volunteered by users post facto.
    - Perhaps many lightweight "see also" pointers could mean "same as"?
  - [[link rot]]
<<<<<<< HEAD
    - Perhaps not as bad in an [[agora]] due to the fact that most links will be to nodes and not to subnodes?
