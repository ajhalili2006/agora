- I'd like to collect materials for this kind of course, with a view towards doing this type of teaching
- **Some resources:**
    - The book [[Conceptual Mathematics]] by Shanuel and Lawvere ? 
    - Perhaps material form Eugenia Cheng ? 
- 
- **Possible target audiences:**
    - Architecture students via Ludgar Hovestadt
    - DGESS?
    - ZHDK?
    - online in one form or another?
    - collaborate with Statebox for teaching category theory?
