- Recap
  - Scientific Knowledge
    - Concepts
    - Method to use the Concepts
    - Produce propositions, determinations
    - Giving of reasons
    - Argue if right or wrong

  - Other ways of knowing
    - magical systems of knowledge
     - e.g. 
      - using the notion of resemblance and similarities
        - only works by comparing two or more things
        - not based on discourse, but rather based on senses...
      - bringing things to gether again, but that creates a certain force / energy that is able to influence the world
      - not trying to understand what the world "is" in itself, but there is the aspect of wanting to influence and change the world
      - how to produce influence? in kabala and alchemy examples, there were numbers, symbols, relations, resp. substances/materials as essences
    -  paranoic systems 
       -  production of closed circles or reasoning,
       -  false conclusions
       -  "no outside" of the knowledge system. this is a red flag. 
          -  "one need an alterian element", or openness/opening in order to have a kind of knowledge that is, in a way, interesting.
