# Kaltnadel Etching

Notes to the workshop on 2020.11.16

Materials:
- Zinc plate
- Ink
- various tools, oils, cloths

Steps:

One day before
Prep the paper my making it moist (spray it with water) and laying it under glass plates (this loosens up the fibres)

Prepping    
    Round the edges of the zinc plate with the three sided metal tool
    Round the corners with the file
    Get rid of the grain-effect by rubbing it in with some wool balls wrapped in cloth that have a black-is substance on them 
    Wash with water and migros-budget detergent to clear off this substance a bit and also fingerprints

Etching
    Start with the etching, using the long pointy metal tool that looks a bit like a sowing needle
        To test if the tool is sharp enough, put it onto one’s finger nail to see if it slides off or not. 
            If not, it is sharp enough. 
            If yes, sharpen as follows: use the sharpening stone (long and rectangular) and some oil; rotate the needle point on the stone while applying pressure from above with one’s thumb
    To remove slightly protruding metal that is pushed upright during the etching process, use the three-sided metal tool very gently (use the fact that it is rounded to avoid introducing new         scratches in undesired places)
    To “erase” etches, use the the very smoothly rounded metal tool to “rub” out the undesired marks

Applying Ink
    Use the small spatula to apply a not-too thick layer of ink to the plate
    Use the soft cylindrical things to push the ink into the grooves using a round twisting motion
    Use the side of one’s palm to wipe the ink off (and push further into the grooves?)
    Clean off the ink further by dabbing in circular motions with cloth that is formed into a ball shape
    Clean off ink from the edges and back of the plate as needed

Printing 
    Lay grey paper at the bottom surface of the print-machine
    Lay the zinc plate face up on top of the grey paper
    Get paper to be printed and lay on top of the zinc plate (the side to be printed should be the rougher side)
    Cover the above three layers with the two layers of cloth of the printing machine
    Prep the printing machine by tightening the screws as far as possible, and then loosing them by a quarter turn
    Print by turning the wheel, take your print using the “large ink safe tweezers” in case one’s hands are full of ink

Drying the print
    The print goes into the stack of boards, itself sandwiched between two gray paper sheets. The stack puts pressure so the print remains flat while drying. 

Cleaning 
    The zinc plate can is cleaned by using the “Zügerer” oily solution in the ventilated room, and wiped with the wool balls. 
    The wool balls are disposed in the fire-safe trash bin. 
    The zinc plate is also then finally cleaned using detergent and water?
