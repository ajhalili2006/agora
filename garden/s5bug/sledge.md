# sledge

- Work-in-progress programming language.
- Meant to look like [[fs2]]-based programs, but with a [[Zig]]-like paradigm.
- Completely disallows mutability in the source code to allow for better
  optimizations, and to allow for returning variably-sized objects like
  buffers or closures on the stack instead of the heap.
- Meant to compile to native code like [[Zig]] and have manual memory
  management like [[Zig]].
- Meant to have typeclasses like [[Scala]] and operator overloading like
  [[Scala]].
