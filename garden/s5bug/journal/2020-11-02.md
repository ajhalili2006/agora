- Chatted with [[jesyspa]] about a field-independent way to define division
  such that division by zero is ill-typed.
- Wrote a program that takes a list of Google Cloud Bucket URLs and runs them
  through speech recognition. The goal is to get class lectures out of a
  chronological form so they can be used directly as notes.
- Took the second exam for my Political Science class. Abused my transcribing
  program. Didn't cheat by using any internet resources during the exam. I had
  to admit on some of my free responses that I missed some of the reading
  assignments, but I think prior knowledge helped me out a lot.
- Played [[Hypixel]] again with [[SamSeawell]] and [[Sirius902]] against my
  better judgement.
