- Talked with [[Jesyspa]] about "inverting" complex maps for a tool that will
  render transformations to the complex plane.
- Continued work on my implementation of a `HashMap` and `HashSet` for
  [`cats-collections`](https://github.com/typelevel/cats-collections).
- Looked into [[Horizon EDA]] for development of asynchronous circuits.
- Looked into the usage of [[Chisel]] to make managing and testing custom
  components easier.
- Worked with [[Tenri]] on developing the complex map tool as a website, using
  [Outwatch](https://outwatch.github.io/?lang=scala) and
  [MathLive](https://mathlive.io/). It exists at
  https://gitlab.com/srnb/complexmap.
