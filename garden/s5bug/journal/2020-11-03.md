- Discussed the legalities of my LEGO Star Wars: The Complete Saga
  [[decompilation]] project with the [[Ocarina of Time]] [[decompilation]]
  group. None of us are lawyers, but the consensus that was reached was that
  the EULA doesn't have legal authority over ground-up reverse engineering
  projects.
- Having trouble focusing on English work. I'm 3 weeks behind and it's all due
  in 6 days.
- Decided to watch [[Minecraft, but it's Everywhere At The End Of Time]] again.
