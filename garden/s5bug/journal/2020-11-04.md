- Worked with [[Flancian]] to squash some bugs in their Agora renderer and in
  my garden.
- Looked into human-readable duration parsing for [[Java]] and was recommended
  NaTTY.
- Looked into reverse-engineering the protocol used by the ASCII GameCube
  controller, meant for Phantasy Star Online.
  - Discussed with [[Sirius902]] on how feasible it is to get the ASCII
    GameCube controller working as a normal PC keyboard.
