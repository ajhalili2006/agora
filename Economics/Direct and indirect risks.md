# Direct and indirect risks

Go back to the [[Risk Management Main Page]]

The devil you know vs the devil you don't.

Direct: 

- Those that a company see day-to-day, both physical and financial
- Sees them coming

Indirect:

- Doesn't see day-to-day, but might be exposed to through a competitor's good fortune
- Might come through a supply chain
