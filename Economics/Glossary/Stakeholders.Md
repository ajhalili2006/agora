# Stakeholders

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


All the parties that have an interest, financial or otherwise, in a company, including shareholders, CREDITORS, bondholders, employees, customers, management, the community and GOVERNMENT. How these different interests should be catered for, and what to do when they conflict, is much debated. In particular, there is growing disagreement between those who argue that companies should be run primarily in the interests of their shareholders, in order to maximise shareholder value, and those who argue that the wishes of shareholders should sometimes be traded off against those of other stakeholders.
