# Substitution effect

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


When the PRICE of petrol falls people buy more of it. There are two reasons.

The INCOME EFFECT: cheaper petrol means that real purchasing power rises, so consumers have more to spend on everything, including petrol.

The substitution effect: petrol has become cheaper relative to everything else, so people switch some of their CONSUMPTION out of goods that are now relatively more expensive and buy more petrol instead.
