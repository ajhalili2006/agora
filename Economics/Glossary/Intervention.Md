# Intervention

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


When CENTRAL BANKS try to influence an EXCHANGE RATE by buying the currency they want to appreciate and selling the one they want to weaken. The evidence seems to suggest that it is at best a short-term measure. In the longer term, governments probably do not have the resources to beat MARKET FORCES.
Investment

Putting MONEY to work, in the hope of making even more money. Investment takes two main forms: direct spending on buildings, machinery and so forth, and indirect spending on financial SECURITIES, such as BONDS and SHARES.

Traditionally, economic theory says that a country's total investment must equal its total SAVINGS. But this has never been true in the short run and, as a result of GLOBALISATION, may never be even in the long run, as countries with low savings can attract investment from overseas and foreign savers lacking opportunities at home can invest abroad (see FOREIGN DIRECT INVESTMENT).

The more of its GDP a country invests, the faster its economy should grow. This is why GOVERNMENTS try so hard to increase total investment, for instance, using tax breaks and subsidies, or direct PUBLIC SPENDING on INFRASTRUCTURE. However, recent evidence suggests that the best way to encourage private-sector investment is to pursue stable macroeconomic policies, with low INFLATION, low INTEREST RATES and low rates of TAXATION. Curiously, economic studies have not found evidence that higher levels of investment lead to higher rates of GDP GROWTH. One explanation for this is that the circumstances and manner in which money is invested count at least as much as the total sums invested. It ain't how much you do, it's the way that you do it.
Invisible hand

Adam SMITH's shorthand for the ability of the free market to allocate FACTORS OF PRODUCTION, goods and SERVICES to their most valuable use. If everybody acts from self-interest, spurred on by the PROFIT motive, then the economy will work more efficiently, and more productively, than it would do were economic activity directed instead by some sort of central planner. It is, wrote Smith, as if an 'invisible hand' guides the actions of individuals to combine for the common good. Smith recognised that the invisible hand was not infallible, however, and that some GOVERNMENT action might be needed, such as to impose ANTITRUST laws, enforce PROPERTY RIGHTS, and to provide policing and national defence.
