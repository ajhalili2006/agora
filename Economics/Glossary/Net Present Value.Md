# Net present value

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


A measure used to help decide whether or not to proceed with an INVESTMENT. Net means that both the costs and benefits of the investment are in cluded. To calculate net present value (NPV), first add together all the expected benefits from the investment, now and in the future. Then add together all the expected costs. Then work out what these future benefits and costs are worth now by adjusting future cashflow using an appropriate DISCOUNT RATE. Then subtract the costs from the benefits. If the NPV is negative, then the investment cannot be justified by the EXPECTED RETURNS. If the NPV is positive, it can, although it pays to make comparisons with the NPVs of alternative investment opportunities before going ahead.
Network effect

When the value of a good to a consumer changes because the number of people using it changes. For instance, owning a phone becomes more valuable as more people are plugged into the telephone network. Network effects are sometimes called network EXTERNALITY, although this implies, often wrongly, that the benefits from being part of a network are a sort of MARKET FAILURE. They give a huge COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE to the firm that owns the network. This INCUMBENT ADVANTAGE arises because a new entrant must persuade people to join a network that starts with fewer members, and thus may be less valuable to them than the network they are currently in. This is why markets for products with network effects are often dominated by only a few firms or a single MONOPOLY. Some economists argue that many recent technological innovations, notably the Internet, have large positive network effects, which make possible much higher PRODUCTIVITY and growth than in the past.
