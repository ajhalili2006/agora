# Regressive tax

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


A tax that takes a smaller proportion of INCOME as the taxpayer’s income rises, for example, a fixed-rate vehicle tax that eats up a much larger slice of a poor person’s income than a rich person’s income. This goes against the principle of VERTICAL EQUITY, which many people think should be at the heart of any fair tax system.
