Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


A measure of the responsiveness of DEMAND to a change in PRICE. If demand changes by more than the price has changed, the good is price-elastic. If demand changes by less than the price, it is price-inelastic. Economists also measure the ELASTICITY of demand to changes in the INCOME of consumers.
