# Satisficing

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


Settling for what is good enough, rather than the best that is possible. This may occur in any situation in which decision makers are trying to pursue more than one goal at a time. CLASSICAL ECONOMICS and NEO-CLASSICAL ECONOMICS assume that individuals, FIRMS and GOVERNMENTS try to achieve the OPTIMUM, best possible outcome from their decisions. Satisficing assumes they decide for each goal a level of achievement that would be good enough and try to find a way to achieve all of these sub-optimal goals at once. This approach to decision making is commonplace in behavioural economics. It can be regarded as a realist's theory of how decisions are taken. The concept was invented by Herbert Simon (1916-2001), a Nobel Â­prize-winning economist, in his book, Models of Man, in 1957.
