# NGO

Short for non-government organisation. Although such groups have existed for generations (in the early 1800s, the British and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society played a powerful part in abolishing slavery laws), recent social and economic shifts have given these typically voluntary, non-profit, 'issue-driven' organisations new life. The collapse of COMMUNISM, the spread of democracy, technological change and economic integration (GLOBALISATION, in short) have each helped NGOs grow. Globalisation itself has exacerbated a host of worries about the environment, LABOUR rights, human rights, consumer rights, and so on. Democratisation and technological progress have revolutionised the way in which citizens can unite to express their disquiet.

Governments have been at the sharp end of pressure from NGOs. Arguably, however, it is inter-governmental institutions such as the WORLD BANK, the IMF, the UN agencies and the WORLD TRADE ORGANISATION (WTO) that have felt it more, owing to their lack of political leverage. Few parliamentarians will face direct pressure from the IMF or the WTO, but every policymaker faces pressure from citizens' groups with special interests. Add to this the poor public image that these technocratic, faceless bureaucracies have developed, and it is hardly surprising that they are popular targets for NGO 'swarms'. How governments and inter-governmental organisations respond to NGOs could have huge implications, including for the world's economies. Equally important will be how NGOs themselves respond to greater scrutiny and to growing concern about how accountable they are, and to whom.
