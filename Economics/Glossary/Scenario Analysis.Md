Testing your plans against various possible scenarios to see what might happen should things not go as you hope. Scenario analysis is an important technique in RISK MANAGEMENT, helping FIRMS and especially financial institutions to ensure that they do not take on too much RISK. Its usefulness does of course depend on risk managers coming up with the right scenarios.
