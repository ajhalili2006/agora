# Speculation

Go back to the [[Economic_Glossary]]


An attitude to INVESTMENT that is often criticised. According to critics, speculation involves buying or selling a financial ASSET with the aim of making a quick PROFIT. This is contrasted with long-term investment, in which an asset is retained despite short-term fluctuations in its value. Speculators actually play a valuable role in FINANCIAL MARKETS as their appetite for frequent buying and selling provides LIQUIDITY to the markets. This benefits longer-term investors, too, as it enables them to get a good PRICE when they do eventually sell.
