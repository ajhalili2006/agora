Go back to [[Economics main page]]

Similiar to housing starts. 

Earliest glimpse of what's going to happen to the economy as far as private building goes. 

Not all will becomes starts, so more speculative. 

Seasonally adjusted annual rate means rate for the year based on this month assuming this month is representative. 

Has similar exposed-sector flow-on effects as starts.
