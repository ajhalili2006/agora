# Inflation Rates And Yield Curves

Go back to [[Economics main page]]

Yield curve is a graphical depiction of interest rates paid on government debt that goes out 30 years in the future.

30 year treasury rate is the base rate for the 30 year rate for consumer credit

Longer term --> Higher interest rate <-- Higher risk

Inverted yield curve means that the economy is expected to collapse.
